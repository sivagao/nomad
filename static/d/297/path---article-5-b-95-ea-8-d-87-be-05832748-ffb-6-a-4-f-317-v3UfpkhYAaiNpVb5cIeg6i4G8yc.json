Hostels in Naples usually includes free WiFi, breakfast, and linens. My suggested place is:</p><p><strong>Budget hotel prices</strong> &#8211; A night in a 2-star budget hotel starts around 35 EUR and includes usually a private bathroom, free WiFi, breakfast, and television. On Airbnb, you can find shared rooms starting around 10 EUR per night while entire apartments being at 30 EUR per night.</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s easy to have a great (and expensive) meal anywhere in Italy, but it&#8217;s also easy to eat for less than 15 EUR a day if you make the effort. You can eat very cheaply in this town. As the birthplace of pizza, there is no shortage of options under 10 EUR. If you want a nicer meal, expect to spend around 25 EUR for dinner including a drink. The coperto (table charge) is usually 1-3 EUR and is a rip off, but unfortunately built into every bill. If you&#8217;re feeling ambitious and staying somewhere with a kitchen, you can cook your own food, with groceries (basic food stuffs like pasta, vegetables, chicken, etc) costing around 60 EUR per week. If you find a discount grocer like Eurospin, In&#8217;s Mercato, LD Market, Lidl or Penny Market, you&#8217;ll pay a lot less.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; Traffic in Naples is nuts, and taxis tend to be expensive. Walk where you can. Public transportation in Naples is all owned by different companies, so it&#8217;s best to get a 1-day pass (4.50 EUR) that works on all of them. Transportation passes for a single bus journey cost 1.50 EUR and are valid for 90 minutes. There is also a metro, but it doesn&#8217;t have an extensive network, so isn&#8217;t generally worth the ride.</p></div>","title":"Naples Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea8d87be05832748ffb6"}}
