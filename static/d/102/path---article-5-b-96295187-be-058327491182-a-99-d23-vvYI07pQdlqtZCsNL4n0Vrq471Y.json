I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>What I was up to other than here:</h2><ul><li>I&#8217;ve been in Toronto this week&#8230; more to come later. Make sure you&#8217;re following on my <span><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/hippieinheelsblog\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></span></li><li>I did an interview&#160;<a href=\"http://www.girlabouttheglobe.com/expert-interview-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Expert &#8211; India</a> for Girl About the Globe</li><li>A list came out called&#160;<a href=\"http://www.bobaroundtheworld.com/top-100-travel-blogs-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Top 100 Travel Blogs</a>&#160;and Hippie in Heels was in the top 100.. woo hoo. There were 2,100 travel blogs taken into consideration and 17 of the 100 were solo travel blogs and this here blog was one of them&#8230; it was based totally on the writers&#8217; opinion not stats, but still I&#8217;ll take a pat on the back after writing so much on this website! which I LOVE doing ;)</li></ul><h1>Now your story,</h1><p>Three times a year at my home in Assagao, a guy comes with a big spray bottle and walks around spraying pesticides or something that kills all the bad bugs in your home.</p><p>In the states, we only call on this when we have a problem and don&#8217;t do it preventatively. We also would have to leave the house probably for a couple days after the house is &#8220;fumigated&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what they spray in India but it&#8217;s strong and it&#8217;s pretty intense.</p><p>They spray it around every edge of the house and it takes all day to dry. I have to take the animals outside, but they act like it&#8217;s no big deal and people stay in their house while it&#8217;s being done. Even I have before if I have a lot of work to do.</p><p>For the following days after, lizards fall from the ceiling and cockroaches crawl out from under the kitchen cabinets. Luckily, it means no more ants in the kitchen! The guy didn&#8217;t use to wear a mask but has started to. I took a photo once but can&#8217;t find it!</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post? Let me know in the comments or by sharing it with the social media links!
