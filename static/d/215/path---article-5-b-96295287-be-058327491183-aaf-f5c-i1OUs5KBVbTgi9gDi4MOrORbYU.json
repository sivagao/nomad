This week is a luxury guide to Lisbon, Portugal.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h2>Tips on Visiting Lisbon</h2><h1>A Luxury Guide to Lisbon</h1><h3 class=\"p4\"><p class=\"s1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you can write this luxury guide to Lisbon.</i></b></p></h3><p class=\"p6\">I discovered Lisbon when I was a baby because my mother is from there. I still go back often because I love it so much. It combines everything I consider luxurious &#8211; sunlight, charming architecture, friendly people, nightlife, music, art, and culture. Upon arrival, I immediately feel happy and relaxed.</p><h3 class=\"p4\"><p class=\"s1\"><b><i>What makes Lisbon a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p></h3><p class=\"p6\">Lisbon has a lot to offer. It&#8217;s bathed in a very special light that poets write about and artists try to capture on film and through painting. It has great natural beaches that haven&#8217;t been destroyed by commercialism, a castle with gorgeous views, the most romantic miradouros (lookout points), historical architecture and delicacies you won&#8217;t be able to resist. There&#8217;s also really good shopping. Portuguese designers are very much in touch with tradition, but they know how to adapt their traditions and update them according to the latest trends. There is nice street life and when you go out you may have the chance to hear Portuguese, Brazilian or perhaps Angolan music.&#160;</p><p class=\"p6\">There&#8217;s also really good shopping.
