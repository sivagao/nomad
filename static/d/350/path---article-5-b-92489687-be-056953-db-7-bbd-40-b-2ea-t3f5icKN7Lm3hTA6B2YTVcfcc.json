All three are hailed as landmark pieces of literature, and all three share a common theme: travel. The hero&#8217;s journey, known in literary circles as the monomyth, is a narrative technique ubiquitous across storytelling traditions. A hero must leave behind all that is familiar, all that is safe, wherever or whatever they call home, and venture into the unfamiliar.</p> <p>It&#8217;s easy to see why this theme has been so successful in fiction. When Bilbo sets off with the company of dwarves, he sheds the daily monotony of the Shire&#8212;and how many of us fantasize about doing just that?<strong> It resonates with something inside us, a gut feeling that we are the heroes of our own stories. We crave danger as much as we fear it, if only to look back on a life well-lived.</strong> But adventures are few and far between in the real world. There are relatively few of us who do it for a living, and even then&#8212;adventuring full time is a slightly more nuanced exercise than we&#8217;d find in the pages of Melville, Tolkien, or Homer.</p> <p>And that&#8217;s where travel comes in. It&#8217;s the one element of the monomyth we can successfully replicate.<strong> There may be no gold-hoarding dragons, or obsessive ship captains, or wine-loving cyclopes&#8212;but they aren&#8217;t needed. In the real world, travel alone suffices. To leave behind that which is familiar is to challenge oneself, and meeting that challenge is all the adventure we&#8217;re likely to need.</strong> </p></blockquote> ","title":"We are the heroes of our own stories"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b92489687be056953db7bbd"}}
