I lived there for more than a year and enjoyed its luxury offerings on a backpacker budget!<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7923\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Adelaide-countryside-thetraveloguer.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Adelaide\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p><strong>What makes Adelaide a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</strong></p><p>Adelaide, and in particular the beach suburb of Glenelg, is an ideal place to experience the finer things in life. Home to a marina filled with yachts and amazing restaurants, picture-perfect beaches and surrounded by gorgeous scenery and vineyards as far as the eye can see, it has plenty to offer any traveller.</p><p><strong>What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?</strong></p><p>My favourite hotel in Adelaide is the <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Stamford_Grand_Hotel_Adelaide.htm\">Stamford Grand</a>, a hotel that&#8217;s full of class and with stunning views of the ocean. It has luxurious rooms and the greatest seafood buffet you&#8217;ll ever have, as well as a foodie&#8217;s dream of a breakfast.</p><p>In the city, the Rendevous is modern perfection. Sleek rooms with amazing views of Adelaide and jaw droppingly fabulous bathrooms and make this a perfect city destination.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7928\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/grand-hotel-glengelg-thetraveloguer.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Adelaide\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><strong>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</strong></p><p>If swimming with sharks is your idea of adventurous, then Adelaide is the perfect place! There are lots of water activities to enjoy, as well as skydiving and camping adventures in the bush. Check out even more <a href=\"https://travel2next.com/10-things-to-do-in-adelaide/\">things to do in Adelaide</a>.</p><p><strong>Where are the best hang outs during the day?</strong></p><p>Glenelg is the best place to be in Adelaide, in my biased opinion! It has a lot to offer. There&#8217;s the main street, the epitome of a holiday resort that manages to be both kitschy and chic. The beach and jetty are gorgeous places to hang out. In the summer it&#8217;s packed with tourists and volleyball playing Aussies, people jumping off the jetty, there&#8217;s an open air cinema and spectacular sunsets. In the winter it&#8217;s just as beautiful, only you may want to swap your gelato for a coffee.</p><p>The city centre has lots of parks which are perfect for picnics, and are really popular for weddings. In the summer, Adelaide has lots of festivals which are so much fun.<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7924\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/adelaidebeach.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Adelaide\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p><strong>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Adelaide, and what are their best dishes?</strong></p><p>For a date night, my <a href=\"http://thetraveloguer.com/pure-boutique-coffee-bar-glenelg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">favourite place is Pure</a>, a laidback yet stylish heaven, with trendy d&#233;cor, very cool waiters and possibly the best food and coffee in South Australia.</p><p>For a more romantic setting, Cardones on Jetty Road is perfect. Their oysters are the best I&#8217;ve had. Any of the restaurants along the marina are also great spots for a date.</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</strong></p><p>I think for something sweet, Adelaide&#8217;s best offerings are found in their gelato shops, which tend to have queues out the door no matter what time you get there.</p><p>Afternoon tea in the Grand is another winner, they even offer a take away version, so you can enjoy your cakes by the sea.</p><p>In the city, there is a hole in the wall in Chinatown that sells only macaroons! They come in cute little individual boxes which makes them all the more enjoyable!<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7926\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/glenelg-jetty.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Adelaide\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><strong>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</strong></p><p>Sunset is all about the beach. Any patch of sand in Glenelg gives you a perfect view of the sunset. In Glenelg, the Grand (again) offers a great view, as do any of the bars along the marina.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7927\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Glenelgsunet.jpg?resize=560%2C734&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Adelaide\" width=\"560\" height=\"734\"></p><p><strong>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>Well, a not-so-glamorous spot is the iconic Jetty Bar on Jetty Road. Filled with backpackers and Aussie holiday-makers, it&#8217;s a good spot for some pre-game fun. The Dublin is also great for a good time.</p><p>The Sunset Bar and The Pier on Glenelg&#8217;s marina, and Casablabla in the city centre are perfect for cocktails.</p><p>[Book a room | Book a flight]</p><p>&#160;</p><p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-7935 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013-1-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"traveloguer\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Christine is the editor of&#160;<a href=\"http://thetraveloguer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Traveloguer</a>&#160;a travel blog of a girl with itchy feet and a lust for wander.
