The price usually includes free WiFi and linens. Expect higher prices in the summer season. One of the biggest hostels is called Plus Florence Hostel (which has an indoor pool, outdoor pools, sauna, Turkish bath, fitness center, bar, a great buffet breakfast, drinks, live music, and parties) but my favorite in the city is <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/ostello-archi-rossi.en.html?aid=362916&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ostello Archi Rossi</a> ! Definitely stay here if you can.</p><p><strong>Budget hotel prices</strong> &#8211; A night in a 2-star budget hotel in a room that sleeps two starts around 35 EUR (expect to pay nearly double in the high season). Included in this price are basic hotel amenities, like a private bathroom, free WiFi, and television. On Airbnb, you can find shared rooms starting at 10 EUR per night. You can rent entire homes (usually studio apartments) starting at 25 EUR per night, although you&#8217;ll find a lot more inventory starting at 40 EUR and up.</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; While eating out in the city is expensive, the good thing about Italy is that you can get pizza and pasta for reasonable prices &#8211; and this city is no exception. You can get two slices of pizza and a bottled water for about 10 EUR. For dinner with wine, expect to spend around 25 EUR. At most restaurants, add 3 EUR for the coperto (sit-down fee) that covers service and the bread at the table. You can find cheap sandwich shops all over the city for around 6 EUR a panini, and fast food costs around the same. Gelato will be around 1 EUR and you can find cappuccino for less than 2 EUR. If you&#8217;re feeling ambitious and staying somewhere with a kitchen, consider cooking your own food. Expect to pay 60 EUR per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; Florence, especially the city center, is very walkable. A bus ticket that&#8217;s valid for 90 minutes costs 1.20 EUR (or 2 EUR if purchased on the bus).  For a 10-minute taxi ride, expect to pay between 10-20 EUR. Uber, the taxi alternative, is available in Florence.</p></div>","title":"Florence Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea8587be05832748ffb2"}}
