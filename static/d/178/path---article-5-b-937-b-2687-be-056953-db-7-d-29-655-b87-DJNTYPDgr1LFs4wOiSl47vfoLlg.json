At the moment, Hong Kong and mainland China are seen as different, so mainland profits will be tax free, plus Chinese companies, a very fast growing market, will have no issues dealing with a Hong Kong-based business or bank account.</p><h4 name=\"7fce\" id=\"7fce\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">What you need to incorporate in Hong&#160;Kong</strong></h4><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"8548\" id=\"8548\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\">Ability to apply for the company and bank account (in person or through 3rd party)</li><li name=\"4cf8\" id=\"4cf8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Hong Kong business address</li><li name=\"9a0c\" id=\"9a0c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Hong Kong-based company secretary</li><li name=\"f6c2\" id=\"f6c2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Company formation documents correctly filled in (see note 1)</li><li name=\"d233\" id=\"d233\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Company registration fee (1750 HKD)</li><li name=\"5839\" id=\"5839\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Business registration certificate fee (2250 HKD) (see note 2)</li><li name=\"b5e8\" id=\"b5e8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Company kit fee (lots of options but often better to get all the documents you can)</li><li name=\"58e2\" id=\"58e2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Bank opening fee (varies) and opening deposit (sometimes 10,000 HKD)</li></ol><p name=\"fae3\" id=\"fae3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Note 1: You need to make sure you apply for &#8220;off-shore status&#8221; to ensure your company is subject to 0% tax rate.</p><p name=\"4603\" id=\"4603\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Note 2: The business registration certificate fee is <a href=\"http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/bre_lcc.htm#a1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set by the government</a> and changes wildly from year to year, so best to check what it is currently&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;waiting or hurrying a few weeks may save you some money (2,000 HKD). For 2016/2017, the business registration fee is 0.</p><h4 name=\"118f\" id=\"118f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Types of company and bank account you can&#160;open</strong></h4><p name=\"7fe0\" id=\"7fe0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You need a residents permit to open a sole trader business and bank account, so as a nomad, you will need to focus on opening a Limited Company. If you don&#8217;t have a business partner, don&#8217;t worry, you do not need to have multiple people in the company&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;one person can be both director and unique shareholder.</p><h4 name=\"0148\" id=\"0148\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Setting up shop (or at least getting an office&#160;address)</strong></h4><p name=\"5cb9\" id=\"5cb9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Unless you are actually moving to Hong Kong and setting up an office, chances are you will not have a Hong Kong business address or a Hong Kong-based company secretary.</p><p name=\"cf20\" id=\"cf20\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So for nomads, you need to find an agency that can provide those things for you, and very often, they can setup everything for you, and even save you from visiting the country.</p><p name=\"922a\" id=\"922a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The going rate for an agency to provide an office address and a person acting as a company secretary is around 6,000 HKD per year (&#163;500 / $750).</p><h4 name=\"92ca\" id=\"92ca\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">How I set up my business and bank account in Hong&#160;Kong</strong></h4><p name=\"4e45\" id=\"4e45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I used an agency to do everything for me; it was a painless process, and got my bank account and business up and running in 3 weeks. I didn&#8217;t even need to visit Hong Kong.</p><p name=\"bbe9\" id=\"bbe9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I used <a href=\"http://www.companysec.com/incorporate/international-pricing.asp\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CompanySec</a>, which was based on a recommendation from someone who has been using them for 4 years. They are upfront about fees, as well as upfront about subsequent year fees. They are not the cheapest, but offer a good service. Note: This is not financial advice, things change, so always be careful, and seek advice from others if something does not feel or sound right!</p><p name=\"d993\" id=\"d993\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Each agency is slightly different as to what they need from you&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;some ask for a full written business plan and lots of other information. No idea why, it will be up to you if you want to proceed with them if they start asking for lots of things.</p><h4 name=\"aa87\" id=\"aa87\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Alternative agencies to help incorporate</strong></h4><p name=\"acb3\" id=\"acb3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As well as <a href=\"http://www.companysec.com/incorporate/international-pricing.asp\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CompanySec</a>, these other companies have been recommended to help companies get started in HK. I do not have any experiences of dealing with these companies, so their inclusion here is not an endorsement.</p><p name=\"c9e5\" id=\"c9e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://startitup.hk/rates/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://startitup.hk/rates/</a><br><a href=\"http://www.amplusbs.com/fee-table/hong-kong-company-formation-fee\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amplusbs.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.stringbc.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.stringbc.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jumpstartoffices.com/eng/business-registration-hong-kong.shtml\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jumpstartoffices.com</a></p><h4 name=\"4a4b\" id=\"4a4b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">The costs of being a Hong Kong&#160;company</strong></h4><p name=\"6907\" id=\"6907\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">First year formation and business setup, secretary and address<br>Approx. 14,000 HKD (&#163;1250 / $1800)<br>You may also need an opening deposit for your bank account, approx. 10,000 HKD (&#163;900 / $1300)</p><p name=\"641a\" id=\"641a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Subsequent years registration renewal plus secretary and address<br>Approx. 7,000 HKD (&#163;625 / $900)</p><p name=\"fee8\" id=\"fee8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After 18 months, and yearly after&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;accounting and auditing fees (depending on transactions and how much work you do on your accounts!)<br>Expect 5,000 HKD upwards (&#163;450 / $650)</p><p name=\"b924\" id=\"b924\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you are just setting up, these costs may seem quite scary and large, so you may need to evaluate at what point you make this move, or even if in the long run if it&#8217;s worth it.</p><p name=\"0c8f\" id=\"0c8f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As a comparison, using an agency to setup a UK company costs around &#163;100 ($130). Of course, in the UK, corporation tax is 20% of profits&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;so any profit approaching &#163;6,000+ for the year and the costs in Hong Kong start to not seem so bad.</p><p name=\"9a10\" id=\"9a10\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It may be easier to incorporate in Hong Kong if you are already a business in UK, so formation in UK first may be something to contemplate if you are unsure or run in to any issues in Hong Kong.</p><h4 name=\"511b\" id=\"511b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Paying yourself a&#160;wage</strong></h4><p name=\"d5b2\" id=\"d5b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Welcome to the Grey Area! If you want to spend the money you are earning (i.e. take a salary) you need to pay personal income tax depending on the country you are living in.</p><p name=\"a89a\" id=\"a89a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, the company tax regulations in Hong Kong are a lot more adaptable than a lot of other countries, so once incorporated you may find that more of your day-to-day living expenses can now be classed as a business expense. And that means you need to withdraw less salary, which means you will pay less tax regardless of where you are&#8230;</p><p name=\"c364\" id=\"c364\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As this is a minefield of legislation, I am not going to dwell on it much here, but <a href=\"http://www.barefootjournal.com/pay-tax-become-long-term-traveler/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bare Foot Journal</a> gives it a go, but a lot of the info will depend on where you are from.</p><h4 name=\"f997\" id=\"f997\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Other things to note about Hong Kong companies and bank&#160;accounts</strong></h4><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"bde5\" id=\"bde5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\">There are a limited number of online payment providers that seem to be compatible with Hong Kong banks or willing to deal with Hong Kong-based companies. Stripe is not compatible. Braintree is <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/braintree-launches-singapore-hong-kong-malaysia/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">now compatible</a>, and PayPal is fine. But double check your systems work. Have a backup by having business accounts in other countries just in case. <a href=\"http://www.globalfromasia.com/stripe-hongkong/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More Info</a>.</li><li name=\"0fda\" id=\"0fda\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">There are plenty of other countries that offer 0% tax&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Isle of Man / Guernsey / Jersey / Bahamas / Bermuda / Cayman Islands. I haven&#8217;t looked in to them. Wanting to be based in SEA and wanting to do more business in mainland China meant that Hong Kong was a perfect choice for me and my projects, it hasn&#8217;t been done to avoid tax. <a href=\"https://www.streber.st/2015/01/the-best-offshore-banks-of-2014/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See more offshore bank options</a>.</li><li name=\"f2a6\" id=\"f2a6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing\">Having a Hong Kong company does not give you rights to stay and work in mainland China. You will need to get a visa to work in the mainland, or if you want to be there often, you may want to look at incorporating in China too.</li></ol></div>","title":"A digital nomad guide to incorporating a company & opening a bank account in Hong Kong"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937b2687be056953db7d29"}}
