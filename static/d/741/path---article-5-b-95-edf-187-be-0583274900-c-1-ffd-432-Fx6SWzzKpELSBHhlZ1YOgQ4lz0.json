In the nearby beach town of Ao Nang, there is a resort that is nothing short of paradise. Featuring bungalow-styled villas nestled among tropical gardens and sky-high limestone cliffs, the&#160;Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa captures the essence of Thailand&#8217;s natural beauty in design and feel. A two-night stay here for around $45 USD per night had us wanting to stay for an entire month.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9482\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa.jpg?resize=397%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa\" width=\"397\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa\" href=\"http://www.agoda.com/phupha-aonang-resort/hotel/krabi-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa</a> is home to about two dozen two-story villas clustered among tropical foliage with a gorgeous view of the nearby cliff formation. Set a little back from the main road (Route 4203) that runs through Ao Nang, this oasis is clean, quiet, and private, and provides guests with a relaxing oasis from which they can easily access the gorgeous beaches nearby.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Superior_Double\"><p>Superior Double</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9424\" title=\"Bungalow Interior\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-32.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa Room\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>The villas are composed of four separate units, each with their own entrance ways and small balcony. Stepping inside, the octagon shaped main room showcases natural wood floors and stone accents, and has simple Thai silk and bamboo decorations. The king-size bed is very comfortable and topped with a fluffy duvet.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9425\" title=\"Very Cozy and Comfortable\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Superior-Dbl.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Pha Superior Double Room\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>Branching off from the main room is a small luggage area with a sitting bench and a rack to hang clothes. We though it was refreshing to have a separate area to store luggage. Each bungalow is also equipped with air conditioning.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Bathroom\"><p>Bathroom</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9426\" title=\"Bungalow Bathroom\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-34.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bathroom Toilet Sink and Shower\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>The bathroom has an earthy design, complete with a ceramic sink, stone floor shower, and a homemade wooden lock. Linens, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are provided. The water gets really hot and has excellent pressure. The deluxe room even has a tub.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Pool_and_Spa\"><p>Pool and Spa</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9481\" title=\"Swimming Pool in the Shadows of Palms and Cliffs\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-12.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Outdoor Swimming Pool\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>In the center of the Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa, situated among the lush flowers and mature trees, is a pool. Although each villa can conveniently access the pool, the swimming and sunbathing area still maintains a level of privacy provided by the jungle entwined throughout the resort. The pool has a shallow wading area as well as a nearby shower station and bathrooms.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"Poolside Bar Area\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-14.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Poolside Lounge Chairs and Bar\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>There are a good number of comfortable and over-sized lounge chairs on the pool deck. However, this seemed to be a popular hangout place for guests so arrive early if you want a spot!</p>\n<p>There is also a poolside bar and several tables to enjoy adult beverages and fruit smoothies. About a half a dozen tables are available if you want to be outside in the shade with a poolside view.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9480\" title=\"Massage Services\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-20.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Massage and Spa Area\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>The spa includes a large sauna and massage room. The massage services are provided in an air-conditioned massage room that is clean and relaxing, with beds separated by nice white curtains. We were able to make spa appointments by simply calling the front desk. If you would like a specific time, be sure to make reservations prior to arriving at the resort.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Breakfast\"><p>Breakfast</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"Breakfast Buffet\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Breakfast.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Breakfast\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an on-site restaurant at the Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa that serves breakfast from 7am to 10am. There is mostly Western food, including pancakes and French toast, fried eggs, toast and pastries, beans, ham, and yogurt. There is also a good variety of fresh cut fruit available, as well as water, orange juice, milk, instant coffee, and tea.</p>\n<p>Breakfast was decent, but the convenience of it is worth paying for because the resort is a bit far from any breakfast shops. The breakfast package is optional (roughly 350 baht extra per room) and can be chosen during booking.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Free_Shuttle_To_and_From_the_Beach\"><p>Free Shuttle To and From the Beach</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9439\" title=\"Free Shuttle to the Beach\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phu-Pha-Ao-Nang-Resort-Spa-52.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort Shuttle\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa\" href=\"http://www.agoda.com/phupha-aonang-resort/hotel/krabi-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa</a> is 1.5 kms from downtown Ao Nang and the beach area, which takes about 20 minutes to walk. However, there is a free shuttle service for guests scheduled for various pickup times every day. The earliest drop off is 10:00 am and the last pickup is at 10:10 pm, with runs about every two hours. The ride is in the back of a white songthaew that is complete with natural wood interior and fun interior lights.</p>\n<p>Typically a tuk-tuk ride this far from the beach costs 30 baht per person, but this is a free alternative!</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Service\"><p>Service</p></p></h2>\n<p>We stayed in a ground level room near the front of the resort. Even though the front desk was a short distance away, the flow of guests coming and going did not bother us. Additionally, although we arrived a bit early, the staff was able to accommodate us and have our room ready in about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa provides a private van to pick up guests from the Krabi International Airport. For our group of five, this service was an affordable option, costing us 800 baht each way. Alternatives provided directly by the airport include a private shuttle service (800 to 1200 baht) or a public bus (150 baht per person) that will take you to your hotel or guesthouse.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Phu_Pha_Ao_Nang_Resort_Spa_Amenities\"><p>Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa Amenities</p></p></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>On-site Restaurant; Optional Inclusive Breakfast</p></li>\n<li><p>Free Shuttle Service To and From Beach</p></li>\n<li><p>On-site Pool with Poolside Bar</p></li>\n<li><p>On-site Fitness Center and Sauna Spa with Massage</p></li>\n<li><p>Excursion Booking</p></li>\n<li><p>Wardrobe, TV, and Mini Fridge in Rooms</p></li>\n<li><p>Excellent WiFi with Desk Area in Rooms</p></li>\n<li><p>King Size Bed; Additional Bed Available on Request</p></li>\n<li><p>Free Tea, Instant Coffee, and Water</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><p id=\"Suggestions\"><p>Suggestions</p></p></h2>\n<p>There were only two outlets in the room. We recommend bring a three prong adapter if you plan on using a computer. Better yet, bring a mufti-outlet adapter if you need to do more than just charge your phone.</p>\n<p>Unless you are a late riser or normally skip breakfast, we recommend purchasing the breakfast package offered by the resort. The first shuttle to town doesn&#8217;t leaves until 10am, and there aren&#8217;t any nearby dining options.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Overall_Stay\"><p>Overall Stay</p></p></h2>\n<p>The Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort &amp; Spa went above and beyond satisfying our needs for a relaxing and exotic stay near one of Thailand&#8217;s tropical beaches. It offers privacy when needed, but is not too far from the <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/visiting-ao-nang-thailand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ao Nang downtown area</a>, which has plenty of things to do. When we vacation in Krabi, we will be sure to come here again!</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Address:</strong> 395 Moo 2 Soi 13, AoNang Muang Krabi, 81000 Thailand<br>\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>\n<strong>Phone:</strong> (075) 637-191, (075) 637-218, (081) 270-1191<br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> www.PhuphaAonangResort.com</p>\n \n<p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">You May Also Like</h3>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"Phu Pha Ao Nang Resort & Spa"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95edf187be0583274900c1"}}
