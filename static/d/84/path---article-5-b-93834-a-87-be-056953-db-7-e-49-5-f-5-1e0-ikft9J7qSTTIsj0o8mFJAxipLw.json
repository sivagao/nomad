Kelli, our content writer, travels around the US to rodeos with her cowboy husband (for real). We think the ability to travel while working is one of the huge advantages of remote work.

Share your photos and stories, maybe even visit a coworker along your travels, too&#160;:)</li><li name=\"8d70\" id=\"8d70\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If you are thinking of changing to a drastically different time zone then please check with your manager.

Everyone works better when they are in sync on the company vision and how their work ties into those goals. If they know the &#8220;Why&#8221; they can be a part of the creative process to help reach the company&#8217;s goals. On the flip side, if your manager gives you a task and you don&#8217;t understand why you are doing it or how it will help the company, ask!</li><li name=\"5244\" id=\"5244\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Make sure each person has multiple tasks on their plate and is clear on their priorities. Sometimes when working remote, you get stuck on one task because you need to ask someone else about it and they are asleep because of time zone differences or are focused on something else. This is totally fine as long as everyone has a next task to turn to while waiting on feedback from someone else.</li><li name=\"3178\" id=\"3178\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Respect work schedules when planning meetings. No one likes having to move their personal plans because of a last minute meeting. Keep in mind different time zones and try to work together to set meetings times that work for everyone. When in doubt, don&#8217;t be afraid to work together asynchronously.</li><li name=\"7333\" id=\"7333\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Use visuals. A lot of communication in remote situations happens through text, but try to add a visual when possible. I love <a href=\"https://droplr.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Droplr</a> for sharing screenshots with drawings and text on them but other tools can work great too. Literally, if I&#8217;m referring to a share button I will add an image like this <a href=\"http://d.pr/i/cloUJP\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://d.pr/i/cloUJP</a> that points a big arrow to exactly what I am talking about. This helps make sure everyone is on the same page.</li><li name=\"f880\" id=\"f880\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Use a project management tool. This is good advice if you&#8217;re working in-person also, but there&#8217;s no way you can have a remote team without using a good project management tool. The tool itself isn&#8217;t important as long as you can set tasks, assign them and collaborate together. Some popular ones include Trello, Asana, Clubhouse, JIRA and more.</li></ul><blockquote name=\"b56e\" id=\"b56e\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--li\">We organize our communication and company activities around specific actions. So, instead of chatting about something that&#8217;s just popped up or sharing more ideas, we ask how we can save it for later or turn it into an action.&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@katekendall\" class=\"markup--user markup--pullquote-user\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Kendall</a>, CEO at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cloudpeeps\" class=\"markup--user markup--pullquote-user\" target=\"_blank\">CloudPeeps</a></blockquote><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"c2be\" id=\"c2be\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--pullquote\">Use a team communication tool. You could use email but it gets disorganized quickly. I recommend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@slackhq\" class=\"markup--user markup--li-user\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a> (which we use at Octane AI), Hipchat, Twist (a new player in the space from all-remote <a href=\"https://medium.com/@doist\" class=\"markup--user markup--li-user\" target=\"_blank\">Doist</a>) or a similar tool. Organize your communication in channels so it&#8217;s easier to find the information you need.</li><li name=\"6742\" id=\"6742\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Escalate the medium, not the message. If you are having a conflict with a coworker in a text chat, don&#8217;t just continue to disagree in text. Hop on the phone or do a video call. With just text, we lose tone and body language and it can more quickly lead to a huge disagreement. If things are getting tense, get on a video call.</li></ul><blockquote name=\"fa3a\" id=\"fa3a\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li\">&#8220;At PowerToFly, we make sure that direct reports have at least one weekly video chat or voice call each week. This allows us to hear any issues that can&#8217;t be interpreted via email or group chats.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@kzaleski\" class=\"markup--user markup--pullquote-user\" target=\"_blank\">Katharine Zaleski</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@powertofly\" class=\"markup--user markup--pullquote-user\" target=\"_blank\">PowerToFly</a></blockquote><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"bbbd\" id=\"bbbd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--pullquote\">Give people the benefit of the doubt. If they sound a bit terse, it might be that English is their second language or it might be that they had a very late night with a baby. Try to understand things from their point of view, empathy is an incredibly valuable asset in a remote worker.</li><li name=\"142f\" id=\"142f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Consider a team retreat. It&#8217;s not 100% necessary, but one thing remote teams do is use some of the money they save on office space to invest in a yearly team retreat. When I was VP of Product at RebelMouse I worked with some people for years before meeting then and we always worked well together, but I will say that when I did finally meet them it was an incredible bonding experience and helped us communicate even better in the future.

For real, this is very important. Your brain needs a break to recharge and be creative. Set up do not disturb times in slack which can let you relax and not get buzzed with notifications.

You having a life makes you a better worker too.</p><p name=\"dd77\" id=\"dd77\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Be truly productive when you are working. Focus on using the hours in the best possible way. Setup your environment so you can focus and make sure you are clear on your priorities (otherwise ask your manager).

It all depends on your ideal working schedule.</li><li name=\"912d\" id=\"912d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Ensure you have a work environment (home office, co-working spot, etc) where you can focus and not be disturbed.</li><li name=\"9dc3\" id=\"9dc3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Since you are working intensely during your work-day, fully unplug when you are not working.

I spent several weeks testing different working schedules, and I found that I work best from 6am&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;3pm. I&#8217;ve learned to do my most in-depth work in the morning and save the easier things for the afternoon when my brain is winding down. I highly suggest resources like <a href=\"https://journal.thriveglobal.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive Global</a> or <a href=\"https://themission.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Mission</a> to learn about different working styles and productivity hacks.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@kellikissack\" class=\"markup--user markup--li-user\" target=\"_blank\">Kelli Kissack</a></li><li name=\"d839\" id=\"d839\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Be time zone aware. &#8220;Can you find ways to be more asynchronous and inclusive of all time zones?

If you stop talking to people face to face, it becomes harder after time. I think having live interaction every day is really important, no matter how silly it sounds.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Milena</li><li name=\"6b01\" id=\"6b01\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Look into tax benefits of having a home office. &#8220;You may be able to deduct your home office expenses.

Some had awesome comfortable chairs with a quiet atmosphere and other people also working, while other places had really uncomfortable chairs or tables. By investigating ahead of time, I could make sure I was comfortable and ready for work.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Rodrigo</li><li name=\"0680\" id=\"0680\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Figure out your priorities for a workspace. &#8220;Set a clear baseline, minimum requirements for what you expect from a co-working space in which you will do your best work. This helps when researching and reviewing co-working spaces and helps you ask the right questions when speaking to them.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@kzaaaam\" class=\"markup--user markup--li-user\" target=\"_blank\">Keji Adedeji</a></li><li name=\"d400\" id=\"d400\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Take notes and write down priorities &#8220;I love using a paper notebook for my priorities for the day and notes in meetings. I find that then when I go over my notes to save it somewhere in digital form or send to someone else I really synthesize the important stuff and focus better than if I just took notes digitally to begin with.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Megan</li><li name=\"4769\" id=\"4769\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Invest in a nice work setup. &#8220;I use a laptop stand for my laptop (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Roost-Laptop-Stand-Productivity-Lightweight/dp/B01C9KG8IG\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> if you&#8217;re curious and I don&#8217;t even get a commission if you buy it) which is so useful because some cafes or coworking spots have really low tables and you end up hurting your neck after a while so your work setup has to be great and that extra expense for a quality stand and portable keyboard is totally worth it.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Rodrigo</li><li name=\"05f0\" id=\"05f0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Food is fuel. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to eat&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Milena</li><li name=\"c6e0\" id=\"c6e0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Get in time with the fam! &#8220;I love working remotely because it&#8217;s easy for me to go home and visit my parents in Oregon and then spend a week eating lunches, dinners and hanging out with them in the evening while still doing my job. It&#8217;s an awesome way to take advantage of our ability to work from anywhere.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Megan</li><li name=\"75b2\" id=\"75b2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Set boundaries with friends and family. &#8220;You may need to set boundaries on people outside the company who presume working remotely means they can interrupt you anytime, or that you can drop what you&#8217;re doing or quit early, or who simply don&#8217;t realize that you are working at a full-time job with responsibilities, deadlines and other people who need your immediate attention. Even people with workplaces often goof off at them, so it&#8217;s normal for others to not realize you are &#8220;at work&#8221; when you&#8217;re sitting on your patio with a laptop and lemonade. But most will respect that boundary once they realize it exists.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@paulboutin\" class=\"markup--user markup--li-user\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Boutin</a></li></ul><p name=\"86cb\" id=\"86cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Do you work remotely? </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40meganberry%2Fthe-complete-guide-to-working-on-a-remote-team-6bb11213e37c&amp;text=Hey%20@meganberry%2C%20I%20loved%20your%20remote%20team%20guide.%20I%20have%20some%20tips%21\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Send me your tips</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> and I&#8217;ll add in the best ones!</strong></p><p name=\"98d1\" id=\"98d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I believe the future of work is going to be remote, do you agree? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40meganberry%2Fthe-complete-guide-to-working-on-a-remote-team-6bb11213e37c&amp;text=I%20definitely%20agree%20with%20@meganberry%20that%20the%20future%20of%20work%20is%20remote%21%20%20\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Let me know!</a> Share this with your remote coworkers and let&#8217;s figure this out together.</p><p name=\"6ccb\" id=\"6ccb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Follow me on Twitter as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/meganberry\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@meganberry</a>.
