It&#8217;s a pretty popular spot to dine at by both visitors and expats and is often recommended as a thing to do in town.</p>\n<p>The Chiang Mai Gate food stalls start setting up around 5 pm every day and a few vendors even stay open past midnight. A great variety awaits the curious consumer and all for the going price of about a dollar per dish.</p>\n<p>Here are our recommendations, which include a tour of our favorite vendors and a week&#8217;s worth of dinners for less than 100 baht (3 USD!) per meal.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12958\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Map-1000px.jpg?resize=904%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Chiang Mai Gate Food Stalls Map\" width=\"904\" height=\"779\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p> Whenever we reference &#8220;to the left&#8221; or &#8220;to the right&#8221;, it is as if you are standing directly in front of the food stall looking at it (not behind or to the side).\n\n\n\n<h2><p id=\"MONDAY_Fruit_Smoothie_and_Beef_Noodle_Soup\"><p>MONDAY </p>Fruit Smoothie and Beef Noodle Soup</p></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>20 BAHT</strong></p>\n+\n<p><strong>35 BAHT</strong></p>\n=\n<strong><p>55 BAHT</p></strong>\n\n\n<p>MANGO, PASSION FRUIT, &amp; PAPAYA SMOOTHIE</p>\n<p>BEEF NOODLE SOUP</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12942\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-8.jpg?resize=1000%2C742&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Famous Ms. Pa at the Chiang Mai Gate Food Stalls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\"></p>\n<p>Ms. Pa and her fruit smoothies are well known among the Chiang Mai Gate food stall scene.

He has an English menu from which to easily order, several tables, and always has big condiment dishes full of chilies, sugar, and fish sauce within arms reach to jazz up your noodles.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"TUESDAY_Northern_Thai_Curry_with_Egg_Noodles_and_Kanom_Kroke\"><p>TUESDAY </p>Northern Thai Curry with Egg Noodles and Kanom Kroke</p></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>35 BAHT</strong></p>\n+\n<p><strong>10 BAHT</strong></p>\n=\n<p><strong>45 BAHT</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>NORTHERN THAI CURRY</p>\n<p>KANOM KROKE</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-12.jpg?resize=1000%2C719&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Khao Soi from Chiang Mai Gate Food Stalls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\"></p>\n<p><strong>If you had to eat one dish while in Chiang Mai, try the popular Northern Thai curry called <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/khao-soi-northern-yellow-curry-noodles/\">khao soi</a>.</strong> It&#8217;s a cross between yellow and red coconut based curry ladled over fresh egg noodles and topped with a smattering of deep-fried egg noodles.

There is a stand with an umbrella near the Chang Mai Gate brick wall after crossing over the eastbound lanes away from the moat. The vendor offers plain kanom kroke or varieties topped with corn, julienned slices of sweet potato, or chives.

This vendor is located just outside the Chiang Mai Gate brick wall under the morning market&#8217;s awning area.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to grab a mango, pineapple, and banana smoothie from Ms. Pa.

This hot and sour flavor combo is due to lemongrass, gangalal (a root in the same family as ginger), lime, and fresh chilies. Served with Mama noodles (similar to Ramen), wontons, and slices of Chinese kale, grab a bowl of this from the vendor two or three stalls to the right of the Chiang Mai Gate brick wall.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"FRIDAY_Papaya_Salad_Chicken_Skewers_and_Rotee\"><p>FRIDAY </p>Papaya Salad, Chicken Skewers, and Rotee</p></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>30 BAHT</strong></p>\n+\n<p><strong>30 BAHT</strong></p>\n+\n<p><strong>30 BAHT</strong></p>\n=\n<p><strong>90 BAHT</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>PAPAYA SALAD</p>\n<p>SKEWERS &amp; STICKY RICE</p>\n<p>ROTEE</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12957\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-15.jpg?resize=998%2C1004&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Somtum, chicken skewers, and sticky rice combo\" width=\"998\" height=\"1004\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/som-tum-green-papaya-salad/\">Som tum</a> (green papaya salad), sticky rice, and grilled pork or chicken skewers are the perfect northern Thai food trio. The grilled meat vendor has squeezed himself on the sliver of sidewalk along the eastbound lanes of the moat. He has a tall silver chimney with trails of smoke coming out. He sells skewers of bite-sized pieces for 5 baht and bigger portions, such as chicken legs or chicken quarters, for more. This vendor also sells other chicken bits such as tails, heads, liver, and kidney for the more adventurous eater. Don&#8217;t forget to ask for a 5 baht bag of sticky rice.</p>\n<p>Grab papaya salad from the food stall two stalls to the left of him (directly to the right of the khao soi stall). <strong>Make the som tum spicy if you dare with two or three small red chilies.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12956\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-14.jpg?resize=998%2C837&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Husband and wife team making banana rotee at Chiang Mai Gate food stalls\" width=\"998\" height=\"837\"></p>\n<p>End this meal with a <strong>rotee, a snack similar to a flattened stuffed crepe.</strong> We recommend trying the classic custard-like banana and egg filling first, but there are several other fillings to choose from. The finished rotee is sliced into bite-sized pieces and drizzled with sweetened condensed milk, honey, or chocolate. Try one from the husband and wife team in the Chiang Mai market awning area, across the eastbound street from the main moat area stalls.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12950\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-2.jpg?resize=1000%2C573&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Rotee: banana and egg filled crepes, Thai style\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\"></p>\n<h2><p id=\"SATURDAY_Fruit_Smoothie_and_Red_Curry_Stir_Fry\"><p>SATURDAY </p>Fruit Smoothie and Red Curry Stir Fry</p></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>40 BAHT</strong></p>\n&#160;+\n<p><strong>35 BAHT</strong></p>\n&#160;=\n<p><strong>75 BAHT</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>COCONUT &amp; AVOCADO SMOOTHIE</p>\n<p>RED CURRY STIR FRY</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We recommend going to Coffee Build for this filling and super healthy smoothie made from a combination of coconut and avocado.</strong> It&#8217;ll be hard to find anywhere else that makes it this cheap! The flavors are subtle but delicious and we recommend sweetening it up with a single scoop of sugar. A great alternative is a mango avocado smoothie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12951\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chiang-Mai-Gate-Food-Stalls-1000px-5.jpg?resize=1000%2C694&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"This lady makes a mean stir-fry dish at Chiang Mai Street Food Stalls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\"></p>\n<p>Ready for a spicy dish?

Additionally, <strong>the food vendors selling main courses (not desserts or smoothies) have tables to sit at and free drinking water. </strong></p>\n<p>To order, simply approach a food stall and tell the person cooking what entr&#233;e you want to eat and what type of protein you&#8217;d like in it (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, tofu, fried egg). Find a nearby table to sit down at, and the cook will bring your food over in five minutes or less. If you are eating with another person, do not expect to be served at the same time.</p>\n<p>When you are finished eating, leave your used plate and silverware on the table, go back to the vendor, and pay the vendor in cash, preferably in bills of 100 baht or less. They have good memories and will look at you and the tell you the price.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Have_Fun_Exploring_the_Variety_at_the_Chiang_Mai_Gate_Food_Stalls\"><p>Have Fun Exploring the Variety at the Chiang Mai Gate Food Stalls</p></p></h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>There you have it!
