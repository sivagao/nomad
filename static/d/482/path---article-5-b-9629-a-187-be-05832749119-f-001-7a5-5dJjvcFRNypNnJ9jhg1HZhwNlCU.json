It&#8217;s really nice. Unfortunately, I only had one morning here and I had other plans (exploring with Duara&#160;Travels, which I&#8217;ll write about later on). The following am I left, so I missed yoga here. But man, what a kickass place to do it.&#160;</p><h2>The Rooms at Sandat Glamping</h2><p>Just wait for these rooms&#8230;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22272 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22273 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>How amazing are these tents!&#160;</p><p>I love the circular bed. We stayed in a suite tent and it had a pool outside of it. The rooms are spacious, not just for tents. They are bigger than some boutique hotels I&#8217;ve stayed in.&#160;</p><p>While it&#8217;s glamping, it&#8217;s definitely more like a hotel than a tent. It has A/C, hot water, a mini fridge, and WiFi.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22276 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22274 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22275 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-10.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22277 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22306 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-40.jpg?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"803\"></p><p>This awesome guy is showing us a tool that hangs by the door. It makes a strange sound that lets them know we need something. Each tent has a different tool with a different sound.&#160;</p><p>They don&#8217;t come down to the tents without ringing a bell at the top of the path also! I guess this would be because people are skinny dipping! You can definitely hear your neighbors here, and I think our neighbors were on their honeymoon if you know what I mean.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22280 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-15.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22271 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>The pool was insane. I really wish I had one more day to spend here so I could just chill at the room. I got to stay in such cool places in Bali, but for the exception of Villa Sungai, I really didn&#8217;t get enough time in the rooms.&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22303 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-37.jpg?resize=1024%2C794&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"794\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22304 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-38.jpg?resize=703%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"703\" height=\"1024\"></p><p>The water was cold but that&#8217;s because the pool is often in the shade.&#160;</p><h2>Food &amp; Spa at Sandat Glamping</h2><p>Breakfast is a buffet down in the main bamboo room. You can also order more, off the menu. I had yogurt and muesli with some amazing dried fruit they make. I also had the strongest coffee.&#160;it was so good, I had two cups.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22285 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-20.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22312 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-46.jpg?resize=1024%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"1024\" height=\"925\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22316 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-50.jpg?resize=652%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"652\" height=\"1024\"></p><p>I also had a massage here. I have to say, it wasn&#8217;t the best one I&#8217;ve had. The girl was really nice, though. They set it all up in the room and although it wasn&#8217;t a deep tissue massage like most Balinese ones I had, it was still very relaxing. The cinnamon burning below the bed was really nice.&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22302 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-36.jpg?resize=838%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"838\" height=\"1024\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22313 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sandat-Glamping-Ubud-Bali-47.jpg?resize=813%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sandat glamping\" width=\"813\" height=\"1024\"></p><p><a href=\"http://tidd.ly/21103121\">Click here</a> to book Sandat Glamping.</p><h2>Pin it for later:</h2><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"><h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">Related</h3></p><img width=\"594\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/EmailSidebar-01.png?fit=594%2C485&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" et_bloom_image_no_animation et_bloom_image\" alt=\"\"><p>Join my email list and get exclusive updates &amp; news straight to your inbox.&#160;</p><p>I will never give away, trade or sell your email address.
