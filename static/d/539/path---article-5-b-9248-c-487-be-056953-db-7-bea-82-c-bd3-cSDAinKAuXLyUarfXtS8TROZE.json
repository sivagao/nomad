It's part of my challenge to launch <a href=\"/12-startups-12-months\">12 startups in 12 months</a>.</p> <p>Just now, <a href=\"//www.google.la/#q=site:flightfox.com\">FlightFox</a>, a self-described marketplace of flight experts, launched <a href=\"//www.google.la/search?output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=flightfox+best+cheap+cities#q=site:flightfox.com+%22the+17+best+cities+to+live+cheaply%22\" class=\"broken_link\">a new page</a> that looks eerily familiar to people that've seen my site <a href=\"http://nomadlist.io/\">Nomad List</a>:</p> <img class=\"sl_lazyimg\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_250x250.gif\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nomadlistx-1024x513.png\"> <p>Even the city details themselves:</p> <img class=\"sl_lazyimg\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_250x250.gif\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flightfoxcomp-1024x912.png\"> <p>Eventhough they used the wrong picture for Chiang Mai as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ytspar\">Yury</a> notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox\">@flightfox</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">@levelsio</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/FredPerrotta\">@FredPerrotta</a> I like the picture of Chiang Rai for the number one city, Chiang Mai, only 3 hours away.</p> <p>&#8212; Yury (@ytspar) <a href=\"//twitter.com/ytspar/status/521878387829129218\">October 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote> <p></p> <p>It's not just the concept of putting up a list of cities to work from remotely. That's not unique. Sites before <a href=\"http://nomadlist.io/\">Nomad List</a> have done it, and other startups are working in this space, like <a href=\"http://teleport.org/\">Teleport</a>. But it appears as if <a href=\"//www.google.la/#q=site:flightfox.com\">FlightFox</a> directly scraped my site, merely stripping out a few cities and adding a few others to make it look theirs.</p> <p>They obviously thought it was to blatant and tried to cover it up quickly changing the title of the page from:</p> <p><strong>The 17 Best Cities To Live Cheaply for Nomads</strong></p> <p>to:</p> <p><strong>The 17 Best Cities To Live Cheaply</strong></p> <p>However, their <a href=\"//www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=207740842609337&amp;story_fbid=828876310495784\">Facebook page</a> still show the old title:</p> <img class=\"sl_lazyimg\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_250x250.gif\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flightfoxfb-1024x741.png\"> <p>Do I care? No I think it's pretty awesome and flattering. And it shows direct <strong>market validation</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/cwaring\">@cwaring</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/jongold\">@jongold</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox\">@flightfox</a> obvs if inspired by <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">@levelsio</a>, attribute it. Other than that, isn't that the beauty of the web? Validation etc!</p> <p>&#8212; Marie Steinthaler (@marmarlade) <a href=\"//twitter.com/marmarlade/status/521917736126263296\">October 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote> <p></p> <p>If a <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flightfox\">funded startup</a> like FlightFox puts up a page like this, there's obviously people interested in it. And the power of the internet is that people copy. But when you do it so blatantly, it's common courtesy to <strong>link back, attribute and mention your source</strong>. And they didn't. That's not very nice. And it's not very smart PR for them now either.</p> <p>Especially not if you start denying it, then you're pretty much asking for a social media storm:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">@levelsio</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/FredPerrotta\">@FredPerrotta</a> thanks for inventing remote working for us all ;) We'd be so lost without you both.</p> <p>&#8212; Flightfox (@flightfox) <a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox/status/521814578775490561\" class=\"broken_link\">October 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox\">@flightfox</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">@levelsio</a> Sarcasm isn't becoming of corporate accounts, especially when directed at a customer and fan.

If they'd tweeted me or sent me an email to ask me to use my data, I'd love to share it. I even <a href=\"/product-hunt-hacker-news-number-one/\">have an API</a> they could use. Or even if they didn't ask but just attribute Nomad List as a source. But they didn't.</p>   <p></p> <p>Twitter didn't like it:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox\">@flightfox</a> actually, I take back my carry on. Upon further investigation, its a rip-off. You could have been a bit more discrete about it.</p> <p>&#8212; that grum guy (@grum) <a href=\"//twitter.com/grum/status/521940483304472576\">October 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"//twitter.com/jongold\">@jongold</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">@levelsio</a> <a href=\"//twitter.com/flightfox\">@flightfox</a> Don't think they realize how badly they just shot themselves in the foot...</p> <p>&#8212; Freedom &amp; Fulfilment (@FandFdotcom) <a href=\"//twitter.com/FandFdotcom/status/521911767186673664\">October 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote> <p></p>   <p></p>   <p></p>   <p></p> <p>However, if they'd done it appropriately, we wouldn't have all these tweets and this blog post and they wouldn't have given <a href=\"http://nomadlist.io/\">Nomad List</a> all this attention today! And who am I not to embrace that? ^____^</p>    <p>P.S. I just wrote a book on bootstrapping indie startups called <a href=\"//makebook.io/\">MAKE</a>.
