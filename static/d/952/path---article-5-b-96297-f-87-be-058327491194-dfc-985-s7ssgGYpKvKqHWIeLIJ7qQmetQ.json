I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>What I was up to other than here:</h2><h1>Now for your story&#8230;</h1><p><strong>Another airport story coming at you from Mumbai! What can I say, weird shit is always happening at the airports here.</strong></p><p>This one is short and sweet.</p><p>Security was on high alert at the Mumbai domestic airport for some reason. Usually I take through all kinds of things that should be examined and they aren&#8217;t, but this time they examined my camera, played around with my tablet, asked lots of questions about my external hard drive, and per usual during examination asked why I had a piercing in my belly button. They took Ben&#8217;s lighter when they found it (which is the protocol).</p><p>We head up to the food court and Ben goes off to the restroom. I&#8217;m typing away on my computer and smell smoke. I look behind me and there&#8217;s a passenger just smoking a cigarette, in an airport, security watching on. No big deal- after all that security and searching. Everyone loves smoking in India, but this was new.</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post? Let me know in the comments or by sharing it with the social media links!
