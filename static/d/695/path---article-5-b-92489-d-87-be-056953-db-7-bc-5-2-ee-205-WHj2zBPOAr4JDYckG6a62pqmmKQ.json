Here's the transcript. It's pretty rough because I had to be very practical in my presentation, but I hope it's useful for you! Also sorry for the layout on a few of these slides, I did it in Keynote and didn't have a lot of time. Video will be up soon too of this. This presentation was about 30 minutes long and is everything I know about bootstrapped startups really. Most of it comes straight from my book that's out soon which you can pre-order now already: <a href=\"http://makebook.io/\">MAKE</a>. As always I don't claim to know anything, this is just my ideas and hunches. You need to develop your own to succeed, not copy mine :)</p> <p>Here's the video thanks to Growth Tribe for filming it (colors of slides are a bit off but ok):</p> <p></p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7128 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_8750.jpg\" alt=\"img_8750\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7129 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_8752.jpg\" alt=\"img_8752\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"> <p>Sorry for my face, it does these things sometimes &#175;\\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6899 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.002.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-002\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Sooooo I'm here because of a Twitter argument with this startup school's founder (<a href=\"#good\">scroll down to skip to the good part</a>!). He asks why Amsterdam (the city where I come from too) has such a low startup score on <a href=\"http://nomadlist.com/amsterdam\">Nomad List</a>. Well, it has relatively slow internet, not much of a real startup scene and mostly people talking about startups and a few big companies (like Uber) having their foreign HQ in Amsterdam purely for tax reasons, not for the \"ecosystem\".</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6906 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.003.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-003\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6907 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.004.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-004\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6909 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.005-1.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-005\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <h2>There's too much bullshit</h2> <p>It seems the Dutch startup scene (and most startup scenes outside Silicon Valley, I've seen the same in London, Berlin, Barcelona, Bangkok and Hong Kong) consists of:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6910 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.006.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-006\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6911 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.007.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-007\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>We spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have our royalty prince (the guy on the left, who has zero industry experience, yes he's an actual prince) and an aging bureaucrat lady \"boost\" the startup ecosystem by...well...organizing an annual conference called Startup Delta to \"attract\" startups, as if we needed more conferences...</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6912 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.008.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-008\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6913 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.009.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-009\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Dutch startup founder <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alexandernl\">Alexander Kl&#246;pping</a> from Blende tweets \"I have a question. What did Startup Delta really accomplish after a year except for organizing a conference?\".</p> <p>And they can't even keep their site up:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6914 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.010.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-010\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>It's pretty ridiculous. And it's my tax money burnt for nothing. I really hate it. This is why people don't trust governments.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6915 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.011.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-011\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>After this presentation a girl from Startup Delta approached me and thanked me for my critique of their organization and how they loved to invite me to come speak about it. NO YOU DON'T GET IT! YOU ARE THE ENEMY! GO AWAY!</p> <p>To me, all this signifies what it all is in most startup scenes, lots of bullshit. Actually I've been in a few scenes in my life (graphic design, music and now startups), and I think I've never seen so much bullshit as in startups. All talk, little action.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6916 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.012.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-012\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So what's the opposite of talking about stuff? Well, people actually making stuff:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6917 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.013.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-013\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And I don't mean:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6918 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.014.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-014\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Not as a hobby, but making stuff that's actually profitable:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6919 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.015.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-015\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Not many are, and that's the problem. We could have more makers like that if we had less talk and more action.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7121 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/x.001.jpeg\" alt=\"x-001\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>That's why I wanted to tell about bootstrapping startups to profit. Because if I can show I can do it, more people can stop attending these events, and just open their laptop and build stuff. And it'll solve the problem.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6904 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.018.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-018\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>As much as the startup scenes are like this, people in general are getting more sick of bullshit. They're more informed. People don't like being sold to. They want real stuff. That means ads are dead.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6905 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.019.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-019\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Traditional marketing is struggling even reaching any audience anymore because people simply aren't interested by bullshit.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6987 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.020.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-020\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Therefore, the product has become marketing. You make something great. And it mostly spreads itself.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6988 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.021.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-021\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>My story kinda relates to this.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6989 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.022.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-022\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>My first \"startup\" was an analytics dashboard for YouTube. I was a YouTuber back then and saw the need for YouTube multi-channel network (MCNs) to have an overview over all their channels. YouTube's own analytics was REALLY bad back then.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6991 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.023.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-023\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I had never really built anything big for web except for maybe editing some PHP on a WordPress blog.</p> <p>I spent 1 year (!) on building it as it was so difficult. I had to learn about database design with millions of entries per day. I had to learn about calling APIs to read how many views videos had. Then I had to build all sort sof of difficult mathematical calculations on the data. I had to learn design etc.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6992 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.024.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-024\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>But it worked out. VICE became a customer. They stopped using it after a month mentioning \"they didn't really need it\" and never paid a dime. Actually nobody paid a dime for it.</p> <p>So I thought, let's try something different. I'll not spend another year on one project again, I'll just do a shotgun approach and build lots of stuff and see what sticks.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6993 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.025.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-025\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6995 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.026.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-026\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I decided to do 12 projects in 12 months, and for fun I called it <a href=\"/12-startups-12-months/\">12 startups in 12 months</a>.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6996 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.027.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-027\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6998 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.028.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-028\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>The first project was <a href=\"http://playmyinbox.com/\">PlayMyInbox.com</a> which scraped your inbox for YouTube video URLs of music and playlist them. This was useful for me and my friends.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6999 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.029.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-029\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7000 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.030.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-030\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Then I was in a store in Asia and saw some flipbooks and thought, why don't I put animated GIFs on flipbooks? So I did. I called it <a href=\"http://gifbook.io/\">GIFbook.io</a>. And sold a few hundred of those.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7001 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.031.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-031\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Then I made a site that lets you set a goal, deadline and price and if you don't reach your goal your credit card is charged and I receive the money. A few $100k was committed with I think about $10k made by me from it.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7002 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.032.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-032\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I made a site for <a href=\"//remoteok.io/\">remote jobs</a>, as I started traveling and seeing the remote work revolution slowly happening. It aggregated the jobs from traditional job boards which can be done remotely.</p> <p>As I was traveling and trying to work from anywhere, I was living in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong etc. But I wanted to know about more places that were affordable, warm with fast internet. So I made a spreadsheet:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7003 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.033.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-033\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I shared it on Twitter and thousands of people helped to edit it.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7004 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.034.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-034\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>It was the first project that kinda really de-railed and went crazy, in a good way.</p> <p>Then I made a site around it:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7005 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.035.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-035\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7006 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.036.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-036\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I submitted it to Hacker News and it went to #1:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7007 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.037.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-037\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And Product Hunt:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7008 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.038.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-038\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And the front page (!) of Reddit a bit later:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7009 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.039.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-039\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Suddenly I was getting press coverage. It revolved around me traveling and building these 12 startups. How meta, they were helping the startups become successful merely by covering them. The point here is that the products had become the story. Without any marketing.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7010 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.040.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-040\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7011 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.041.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-041\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When it hit TechInAsia I started getting recognized by people in the coworking spaces in Asia and they literally started making photos of me sneakily from a distance:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7012 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.042.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-042\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Then it hit Wired, and I started getting recognized in the street (!) even in the West by startup people:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7013 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.043.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-043\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I hit lots of press with it:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7014 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.044.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-044\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And this is how I felt after everything happened.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7015 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.045.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-045\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Over 2 years, I built the site into a business:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7019 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.046.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-046\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I added paid social features:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7020 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.047.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-047\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And after 2 years, revenue hit (along with the remote jobs site) $40k/m:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7021 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.048.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-048\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <a name=\"good\"></a><br><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7022 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.049.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-049\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>What I learnt here that there's a few stages of doing a bootstrapped startup:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7023 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.050.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-050\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And every stage needs to kinda go well. I'll go through each of these stages now and give you my little secrets and tips.</p> <h2>Idea</h2> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7024 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.051.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-051\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7025 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.052.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-052\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Solve your own problems.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7026 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.053.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-053\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You're the expert on your own problems.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7027 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.054.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-054\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7028 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.055.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-055\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7029 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.056.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-056\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>That's the issue though, as everyone builds either another app to find your friends, another photo sharing app or yet another food delivery service...</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7030 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.057.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-057\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So how to get original problems?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6923 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.058.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-058\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>And how do you do that? Well, travel works because you meet people in new cultures and see how they do things differently. And you'll slowly become different.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6924 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.059.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-059\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6925 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.060.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-060\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>What also works is, working on stuff that's taboo! Because there won't be many others doing it. And you'll be ahead of the curve. Stuff that's taboo/fringe now but big soon is polyamory for example.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6926 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.061.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-061\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Get jobs that you wouldn't take normally. Just to figure out what problems those companies face. And see if you can offer a solution to them.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6927 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.062.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-062\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Go to Burning Man. Although that's kinda mainstream now. Go to some anarchist meetup. Go to a witch ceremony. Whatever it is, do different stuff, meet different people, become different and see different problems.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6928 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.063.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-063\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When picking an idea, don't start wanting to build a spaceship. Start small, like build a tiny rocket and see how high you can go. Progressively evolve.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6929 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.064.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-064\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I started out with a social network for digital nomads.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6930 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.065.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-065\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Now that's it's saturated that scene, I'm slowly evolving it into a social network for travelers. That's a bigger market, and now that I have already validated the niche, I can expand a bit. But I started small.</p> <h2>Build</h2> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6931 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.066.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-066\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So the next stage is actually building your idea.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6932 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.067.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-067\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I'd strongly suggest not outsourcing it. This creates a lot of hassle. Imagine you want to change something on your site and you have to do a Skype call with a developer team and they have to have a meeting about it? Now imagine if you can do it yourself? Takes a minute vs. days!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6933 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.068.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-068\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So do it yourself! Can't code?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6934 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.069.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-069\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You don't \"learn to code\" one day. If you learn to bicycle, you don't have to become Lance Armstrong. Just learn what you need to know WHEN you need it (e.g. when building). Most people just Google everything. I do. Start with the most basic question you have. Like how to make a button:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6935 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.070.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-070\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Then continue from there.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6936 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.071.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-071\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I see lots of people learn entire new giant JavaScript frameworks like Meteor or React, the first time they start coding. That's stupid because it'll take a long time before you have anything practical working. I see them still build their MVP after 3 months because it's so hard. Better is to just keep it simple and build the most simple version with the tools you already know. Ignore frameworks. Keep it plain and simple!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6937 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.072.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-072\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>The first version of your startup doesn't have to be a website. It can be a public spreadsheet on Google Docs.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6938 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.073.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-073\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You can use <a href=\"http://typeform.com/\">Typeform.com</a> to build a basic MVP that can even include a payment box to charge users!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6939 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.074.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-074\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Or use SquareSpace.com to build a basic site. They also let you add payment boxes so you can charge users money.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6940 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.075.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-075\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>WordPress is probably one of the easier ways to build a basic web app as you can use themes and its interface is quite noob-friendly.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6941 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.076.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-076\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>If you can write HTML already, just build a basic page in a text editor in HTML and see how far you can get.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6942 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.077.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-077\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Again I'd press on this. If you're building an MVP (a basic first prototype to launch), don't use giant frameworks. They're bloated and will drag you down. You can always switch to a framework once you have users, money and can hire developers to scale for you.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6943 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.078.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-078\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>With everything I make, I'm sure to build in automation from day one. It's super important. It means you'll have lots of time left to develop new features, or launch more projects (increasing your odds of success).</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6944 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.079.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-079\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>An example of basic automation is scheduled jobs on a Linux server (they're called cron jobs). But most hosting services (like Heroku) will also have some sort of scheduled job planner that'll let you run scripts on certain times. That's literally automation.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6945 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.080.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-080\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>This is important. Add a BUY button, even if it's not functional yet and you don't have a product. Hook it up so people have to enter their credit card information. Then when they pay, don't charge them but record their email and see how many people actually \"would\" pay for your product. Before you have an actual product even. This gives you a basic calculation how much your revenue will be (sales * price / day). And that means you can see if it's actually worth it to build it out further.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6946 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.081.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-081\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>This is another one that won't be popular. But work alone. It. Saves. So. Much. Time. I don't have meetings. I literally go to bed and put my head on the pillow and have a meeting with myself and decide what I'm going to do tomorrow. I don't have to schedule. I don't have to discuss. No compromises. Just what I want myself. Especially in the early stages this is SO important. Your first product can't have compromises. It needs to make a distinct statement.</p> <p>You can always hire people later, even a co-founder, a CTO, or whoever. But oh please, DIY early on!</p> <h2>Launch</h2> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6947 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.082.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-082\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Launching is probably the most important stage of any startup. Because you can have a great product but without a launch you'll never get people to find out about your product.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6948 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.083.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-083\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>A launch is simply getting people to discover your product.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6949 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.084.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-084\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>If you just upload or deploy your app to your server and send it to your friends, it probably won't get very far. You need a substantial audience (like 10,000+ people) to see and use it first. And then if it's good, a few of those might send it on and it'll start rolling.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6950 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.085.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-085\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When are you ready to launch? Well, when you've removed most bugs. And the basic functionality of your app/site works. Don't launch with just an email sign up form (like we'll message you when we really launch). THAT'S NOT A LAUNCH.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6951 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.086.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-086\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When preparing for launch, make sure you don't forget:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6952 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.087.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-087\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Analytics!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6954 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.088.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-088\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Add an email sign up box so you can re-engage users later. Of those 10,000+ people, maybe 10% will sign up, and you'll have 1,000 emails now to talk to later and tell to come back to the site when there's new features.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6955 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.089.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-089\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Add a feedback form. I use <a href=\"http://olark.com/\">Olark</a> free but they're a badly maintained aging dinosaur of a company. Most hip new companies use <a href=\"http://intercom.io/\">Intercom</a> which is great, but not free. Having a feedback form means you can get instant alerts by your users of bugs or features they want.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6956 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.090.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-090\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Now when approaching journalists for your launch, make sure you only pick out the ones that are actually relevant and talk about your industry. That means I can email journalists about Nomad List when they've written about travel stuff before, not chat bots.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6957 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.091.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-091\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Make the story you pitch to journalists deeply personal.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6958 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.092.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-092\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>This doesn't work.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6959 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.093.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-093\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>This is personal and might work.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6960 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.094.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-094\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Also make sure you keep messages to journalists short, they're busy people and get hundreds of pitches/emails every day:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6961 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.095.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-095\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6963 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.097.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-097\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Getting on Product Hunt is a big thing for startups. The best time to submit is 1 minute past midnight San Francisco time as the leaderboard refreshes then. Make sure to participate in the comments section and answer people's questions and implement their feature requests immediately!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6964 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.098.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-098\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You can email your friends or email list that you're on Product Hunt. They'll check it out and if they like it might give you some upvotes.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6966 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.100.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-100\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Hacker News is the more engineer hangout of the startup world. To submit here, make sure you title it properly. HN has a Show HN section, which is like people showing each other's startups. So title it like it: \"Show HN: I made an app/site/thing that does X\". After submitting, get a few (I mean like 4 or 5) people to upvote it. It'll then rise up to the front page. Now STOP! Don't do anything. Let the organic flow take over and if it's good people will upvote it. Otherwise it'll fall down and it's just not good enough for HN's front page. Participate in the comments, but not too much because it'll hit HN's controversy filter which will push it down.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6968 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.102.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-102\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>To get on Reddit's front page, find a subreddit that is featured on the front page in <a href=\"//www.reddit.com/r/defaults/\">this list</a>. Submit it there, and title it in a similar way \"I made an app/site/thing that does X\". Be nice and answer everyone in the comments.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6971 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.105.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-105\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Product Hunt, Hacker News and Reddit are good starts but if you're app is about a very specific niche (like motorcycles), then you need to find the places where your audience hangs out:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6972 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.106.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-106\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6973 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.107.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-107\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6974 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.108.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-108\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So did you validate your idea?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6975 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.109.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-109\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6977 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.111.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-111\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You'll know by checking your analytics.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6976 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.110.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-110\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Your revenue.</p> <p>If it didn't work out. No worries, go back to the idea phase. If it seems promising continue to the grow phase. Yes this is like a text adventure book :P</p> <h2>Grow</h2> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6978 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.112.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-112\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Now that you've launched, and you have a product that kinda works. How can you grow it to a bigger audience (and more revenue)?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6979 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.113.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-113\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Here's where you'll see lots of growth hackers come up to you and tell you they have the magic. They don't. Don't hire growth hackers. They're bullshit.</p> <p>The best growth you can get is organic!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6980 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.114.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-114\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Because it's free.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6981 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.115.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-115\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Most importantly though, not paying for ads and paid traffic means you have direct market feedback. If people open your app or site and then leave, you'll know something is wrong with the landing for example. If people leave after a few days, you'll need to work on re-engaging them. Now if you did pay for traffic and ads, you might get lots of growth for months, but then the money runs out and all those users might disappear overnight! You won't know if you build something people actually want!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6982 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.116.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-116\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So how do you get new users? Well, you get them the first time you launch.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6983 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.117.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-117\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>But it doesn't end there. Nobody said you should launch once. In fact, I think you should keep launching with new features. Not every week, every month, but every few months at least. Launch a new version, tell press and put it all over the internet. Make it into a thing.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6984 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.118.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-118\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>See all those spikes? That's where I launched with new features. It adds to the traffic in the long term.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6985 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.119.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-119\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Another trick is to spin of a new feature into an entirely new product. I've done this multiple times where I was building a new feature and then figured \"hey this could work on itself even better and reach more people\". Add a new domain to it, give it a fresh design and launch it.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7041 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.121.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-121\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Another example is <a href=\"//placestowork.co/\">Places to Work</a>. I was adding coworking spaces to Nomad List. Then at some point I had so many and I made it into a separate page. And I thought, lots of people that don't travel might need a place to work too. So I spun it off.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7110 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.120-1.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-120\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>For example, when the Brexit happened this year, I quickly bicycled home and ran to my computer to make a spin off of Nomad List. I changed the layout and excluded all UK countries from the list. I hooked it up the domain <a href=\"http://escapethebrexit.com/\">EscapeTheBrexit.com</a>. Now it was a search engine for people from the UK to figure out where to flee.

I kinda do it a bit and it works for me. A more famous example is Buffer, who literally wrote about everything they did (the good and the bad) from day one to now being a $10M revenue company:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7046 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.126.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-126\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7047 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.127.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-127\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>One often missed but very important part of growth is making your site easily shareable.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7049 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.129.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-129\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>What I do is <a href=\"/phantomjs-social-media-share-pictures/\">add dynamically generated pictures to each of my individual pages (automatically)</a>, so that their thumbnails on Facebook etc. show the contents of the page in a summary and attract people:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7050 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.130.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-130\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7051 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.131.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-131\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So now that you've got your new users, how do you get them to come back? Or how do you re-engage old users?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7051 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.131.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-131\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Well, remember those email boxes we added in the beginning? Now that you launched you probably have a list of emails you can message. Don't message them too much, but send them a message very few months to tell about new features they might like:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7053 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.133.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-133\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Also, you could add push notifications. That means you can send them notifications on mobile and web if you have new stuff that'd be interesting for them to see:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7052 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.132.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-132\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When I launch a new version of my site, I usually send out an email like this:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7054 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.134.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-134\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I also have dynamic notifications though, like when users are in the same city and they could meet up:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7055 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.135.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-135\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7056 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.136.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-136\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>A great way to keep getting people to come back is simply keep improving your app or site. An example is Snapchat. People simply open it up to see what new filters and features there are as they're added weekly.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7057 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.137.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-137\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You should improve based on user feedback. Use your feedback form and listen to what people say and build based on that.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7058 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.138.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-138\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>As you add new features, see if they work and get used, and if not, scrap them as fast as you added them.</p> <h2>Monetize</h2> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7059 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.139.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-139\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>The final stage is monetizing.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7060 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.140.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-140\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Why should you monetize?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7061 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.141.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-141\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Because a startup that doesn't make money isn't a startup, it's a hobby.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7062 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.142.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-142\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So, don't make free stuff! Charge people for what you build.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7063 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.143.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-143\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>A startup that doesn't charge money will never make more money, whatever the scale is. In fact, the bigger it is the more money it loses.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7064 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.144.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-144\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>To avoid users getting angry later. Make sure you state early on clearly that you charge money.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7065 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.145.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-145\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Don't feel bad about asking for money. You put HOURS of work into this, why can't you get rewarded for that work?</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7066 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.146.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-146\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I used to be a bit more naive and just build whatever I wanted (which is nice too). Now I think a bit more about monetization because I know I have to maintain apps (they will break because of sheer entropy). So I pick ideas where I have some idea of how to monetize them (later).</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7067 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.147.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-147\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Charging money is also another test. It validates your idea. It shows people value it and are willing to GIVE you money. By the metric of startups, where the goal is revenue, that means it's a good idea.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7068 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.148.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-148\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So let's go over some potential business models for startups in 2016.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7069 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.149.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-149\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>IMHO the whole affiliate market where you get commission for people buying or booking stuff (like hotels) is dead. What is left is a very sleazy industry. Stay out of it. I make about $10 per month with hotel booking affiliate income from Nomad List. No, NOT $10k, but $10 dollars. Yes, that's insanely low. Don't even consider it.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7070 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.150.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-150\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Traditional ads like AdSense are dead to me too. They're super ugly and annoy users. And income is low, like $1 per 1000 views. NOPE.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7071 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.151.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-151\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>You know what works and makes A LOT of money? Asking people for money. Yes, insane. But it works. And more than ever people are willing to take out their credit card and pay for stuff they really need.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7072 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.152.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-152\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Think about your app and its features and see which stuff you can charge for. Keep it in the interface but when people click on it, tell them they need to pay directly to unlock it.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7074 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.154.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-154\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I do this on Nomad List. The moment users want to start using premium features (like interacting with other people on the site), this modal shows up and they need to pay to unlock (e.g. become a member).</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7073 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.153.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-153\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7075 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.155.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-155\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I charge recurring membership fees. You want recurring income because as long as people don't cancel, it kinda doubles every year. Your paying userbase keeps building up. Year 1 you have 1,000 people paying $100/y or $100k/y. Then year 2 you add another 1,000, now you have 2,000 people paying $100/y or $200k/y. See? As long as people don't cancel this works well.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7076 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.156.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-156\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>A more recent and interesting model is patronage. It's asking your users for donations. It seems stupid but it works.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7077 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.157.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-157\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>My friend and YouTube vlog celebrity <a href=\"http://twitter.com/abroadinjapan\">@abroadinjapan</a> does this now through patron platform <a href=\"http://patreon.com/\">Patreon</a>:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7078 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.158.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-158\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>Marco Arment does this with his podcast app <a href=\"http://overcast.fm/\">Overcast.fm</a>:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7079 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.159.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-159\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7080 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.160.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-160\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>This is the most important slide of this presentation. I'd suggest strongly to put BUY buttons on everything all over your site and app and see what people want to buy or not. Then remove what doesn't sell.</p> <p>A great example is Buffer, who started kinda like this with a button that then told people the product wasn't even ready yet:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7081 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.161.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-161\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7082 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.162.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-162\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7083 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.163.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-163\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>So ads are dead right? But what about customized ads that kinda fit the site's design and are not obtrusive? Those are native ads!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7084 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.164.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-164\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>I use them on my site.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7085 responsively-lazy\"

either sell them yourself (I do that) or through a native ad network like <a href=\"http://buysellads.com/\">BuySellAds</a>.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7087 responsively-lazy\"

site gets enough fame, sponsorships also work well.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7088 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.168.jpeg\" alt=\"bootstrapping-startups-to-profit-168\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"> <p>When Nomad List launched, on day one I got an email from the founder of WordPress who wanted to sponsor the site and add a mini ad to recruit remote workers:</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7089 responsively-lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bootstrapping-Startups-to-Profit.169.jpeg\"
