During the first two weeks of our new-found freedom, Chris and I trekked across the US and saw our families one last time before leaving for a new life in Thailand. We&#8217;ve spent the last two weeks traveling to and around Thailand.</p>\n<p>In 28 days, we&#8217;ve:<br>\n<strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rented 2 cars</li>\n<li>Rented 1 motorbike</li>\n<li>Drove 1350 miles</li>\n<li>Crossed the borders of 8 states</li>\n<li>Passed through 12 major cities</li>\n<li>Took off in 9 airplanes</li>\n<li>Slept in 12 beds and 1 red-eye economy seat</li>\n<li>Hailed 10 taxis and 4 songthaew</li>\n<li>Walked 25 miles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Living out of a suitcase (well, three) for a month hasn&#8217;t been a terrible experience either, but it will be nice not having to pack everything up and move around every few days. With that said, tomorrow we are moving into our new place!</p>\n \n<p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">You May Also Like</h3>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"First Monthâ€™s Superlatives"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ef8b87be058327490117"}}
