I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>What I was up to other than here:</h2><ul><li>I answered some questions from a really cool Indian blogger, Renuka about being an expat in India: <a href=\"http://www.renuka-voyagerforlife.com/2015/01/is-india-ideal-country-for-expats.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is India an Ideal Country for Expats?</a>&#160;and also participated in a post full of travel bloggers answering this question&#160;<a href=\"http://thehungrypartier.com/whats-craziest-story-foreign-country/\" target=\"_blank\">What&#8217;s your Craziest Story from a Foreign Country?</a> for Hungry Partier with something silly from my first time abroad over 5 years ago.</li></ul><h1>Now your story,</h1><p>While traveling through Karnataka, somewhere near Dandeli, my cab driver offered to eat lunch at his Aunt&#8217;s place who lived on the way to my homestay. I was excited to meet his family and try local food.</p><p>His family of course was amazing and the food was super yum. I took a few photos there but my favorites were this one of his sassy cousin &#8211; model alert! &#8230;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7498\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20141030_152252_1.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"adventures in dandeli\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p>&#8230; and this one, of I KID YOU NOT, a live chicken in a cupboard in the living room.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8065\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20141030_114015.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"chicken in cupboard india\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p>Sorry it&#8217;s such shit quality, but I didn&#8217;t want them to notice I took a photo, so I snapped it quick on my phone. It wasn&#8217;t trapped. If you look you&#8217;ll see the glass is in the middle only. The chicken got down a couple times and walked around then jumped back up to his &#8220;room&#8221; for a nap.</p><p>I was told they will definitely eat it later!</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post?
