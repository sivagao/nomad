In fact, we&#8217;ve done over 250 broadcasts since October 2015 and this platform has become our favorite way to share with our followers what life is like living and traveling&#160;on this side of the world.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-15999 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thailand-Travel-Periscope.png?resize=1000%2C510&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Explore Thailand on Periscope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"510\"><h2><p>Come Travel on&#160;Periscope With Us&#160;</p></h2>\n<p>Periscope is a free and relatively new social media platform that allows a user to live video stream to hundreds of people at the same time with only their smart phone.</p>\n<p>Periscope&#8217;s&#160;tag line is, &#8220;Explore the world through someone else&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; and combines the feeling of live TV with viewer comments. <strong>It allows people to watch what is happening and respond or ask questions as it unfolds right in front of them.</strong></p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-16018 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thailand-Travel-on-Periscope-Cyclo.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\" Travel on Periscope to Phnom Penh, Cambodia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p>Our Periscope followers can join us for a walk around the streets or sit down with us for a meal on this side of the world and see and hear everything that we&#8217;re experiencing almost as if they were there themselves.</p>\n<h2><p>Why We Love&#160;Periscope</p></h2>\n<p>The idea behind our Periscope channel is to <strong>give our readers a chance to see a more personal side of us in living and traveling in Thailand.</strong>&#160;We (ok, Chris) scopes about once per day when we are home in Chiang Mai and often two or three times per day when we&#8217;re on a trip elsewhere in&#160;Thailand. Or in the case of our recent travels, we scoped while we were&#160;in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-15995 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thailand-Travel-on-Periscope-3.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thailand Travel on Periscope - Bamboo rafting in Chiang Mai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p>For us, live streaming has become <strong>the best way to share our experiences because it gives our audience an enhanced interactive perspective of Thailand.</strong> Although we believe that our blog has&#160;and will continue to be a great source of information, we know that watching videos and speaking with us in real time about Thailand&#160;has its appeal.&#160;Plus, we realize that some people simply&#160;prefer watching videos to reading blog posts, so this should be great news to our current and future followers&#160;that have been anticipating our&#160;content in video form.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-15996 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thailand-Travel-on-Periscope-4.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thailand Travel on Periscope (4)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p><strong>There&#8217;s really no limit to what we periscope about.</strong> We&#8217;ve&#160;given tours of our house and neighborhood on Periscope and while riding around the small streets of Chiang Mai on our motorbike.

Once they&#8217;ve joined a broadcast, they can ask&#160;questions and chat along with us.&#160;These comments pop up at the bottom of our screen, are visible to everyone watching, and allows us and all other viewers to read and respond&#160;to them.&#160;The app also allows subscribers&#160;to give hearts by tapping their screen (similar to &#8216;likes&#8217; on Facebook), which let&#8217;s us know that they like what they&#160;are hearing or seeing.</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-15997 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thailand-Travel-on-Periscope-2.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"See the world and travel on Periscope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\">\n\n\n\n<p>Very soon, as a part of our premium membership site, we will be broadcasting to small groups of followers and discuss specific topics such Thai visas, cost of living in Chiang Mai, and working abroad.
