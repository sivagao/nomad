In fact the thought of sharing anything about *me* makes me shudder with thoughts of narcissistic loathing.</p><p name=\"3373\" id=\"3373\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, there comes a time in every man&#8217;s life when something fucks him off so intensely, that cursing over a pint with friends just doesn&#8217;t cut it. A pain that only the internet masses can alleviate.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dQdRXLoUlpGPgGiGe3UIGQ.gif\">Actual footage of me emailing Insure and&#160;Go<p name=\"49d6\" id=\"49d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I speak, of course, about insurance. The modern-day criminals, whom we are required by law (if you want to drive on the roads, for example) to have, yet seem to be completely above the law when it comes to taking our money, and offering us nothing in return but insult to injury.</p><p name=\"b41c\" id=\"b41c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My most recent experience with insurance, is the travel kind. Before leaving London to begin life as a &#8216;digital nomad&#8217;, I initially dismissed the idea of even bothering to buy insurance, having never had a successful claim in my life. But I eventually took the plunge and wasted countless hours comparing insurers, trying to find one that would actually pay out in the event of an accident. I already have insurance on my belongings, so it was purely medical emergencies that I was hoping to find cover for.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NUElefu2hce4tP2p9C2tdw.gif\"><p name=\"fb1e\" id=\"fb1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Many roads lead me to <a href=\"https://www.insureandgo.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insureandgo.com</a>, as their backpacker insurance would cover me for 18 months of travel, which was exactly what I needed. Reviews suggested they were reliable and their ratings seemed to confirm this. So I settled on their &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/backpackers-insurance\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Backpacker Bronze</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">&#8221; </strong>cover, at a total cost of &#163;273.70.</p><p name=\"0879\" id=\"0879\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Included in this package are:</p><p name=\"41c8\" id=\"41c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Baggage: &#163;1,000<br>Excess: &#163;75<br>Cancellation: &#163;2,000<br>Medical screening: Included<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Medical expenses: &#163;5,000,000 (this is what I was buying this package for)<br></strong>Repatriation: &#163;5,000,000<br>Personal liability: &#163;2,000,000<br>Personal accident: &#163;10,000<br>Legal expenses: &#163;10,000<br>Curtailment: &#163;2,000<br>Delayed departure: &#163;200<br>Holiday abandonment: &#163;2,000<br>Accommodation cover: &#163;500<br>Missed departure: &#163;250</p><p name=\"b3ae\" id=\"b3ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You cannot fault them on what they offer for that price, it&#8217;s a fantastic amount of cover for a very reasonable price. Except they don&#8217;t.</p><p name=\"9d19\" id=\"9d19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On May 31st 2018, whilst driving my scooter home here in Bali (<a href=\"https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/activities/motorcycling\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which Insure and Go covers</a>), I lost control on a bend and drove straight into a tree. Which I like to think looked incredibly cool &amp; dramatic like this:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"10c9\" id=\"10c9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">But in reality looked more like this:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"220e\" id=\"220e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I wasn&#8217;t driving fast, but my hand was crushed between the tree and the handlebars.</p><p name=\"c81a\" id=\"c81a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Whilst laying face down on the cold, hard concrete road, struggling to breathe, there was no &#8220;life flashing before my eyes moment&#8221; no deep, philosophical epiphany. My only thought was:</p><blockquote name=\"241b\" id=\"241b\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;I bet Insure and Go will fuck&#160;me&#8221;.</blockquote><p name=\"856c\" id=\"856c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">After being carried to a nearby medical clinic by 2 lovely Australian fellas, (whom I didn&#8217;t get to thank as I never saw them again &#128148;) I was laid down on a bed, and the nurses began to clean my wounds. It was all a bit of a blur up until that point, I actually thought it was worse than it was, it was difficult to breathe, and there was a lot of blood, so being the stoic Englishman that I am, I naturally assumed that I was dying.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2P0Pk32Tc45fgZtDwtWGzw.jpeg\">Goodbye cruel&#160;world.<p name=\"9e4c\" id=\"9e4c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After Bali&#8217;s corner shop medical centre&#8217;s best efforts at cleaning and bandaging me up, I was wheeled off for x-rays. The results showed a broken rib, and my right hand was broken in 4 places.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zV27zpLC8mCgchxrJwBK8A.png\">&#8220;They call me Mr.&#160;glass!&#8221;<p name=\"19ba\" id=\"19ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Which ultimately was a lot better than I was expecting. But on the other hand (no pun intended) my finger-tip was hanging off.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mP7CS6wqMcfU8oaZQx2Jfg.jpeg\">Old righty will never be the same again&#160;&#128148;<p name=\"47bf\" id=\"47bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The clinic then said I needed to go to A&amp;E, but being Bali, they sent me in a taxi as it was quicker than waiting for an ambulance. (the level of healthcare here leaves a fair amount to be desired)</p><p name=\"ef41\" id=\"ef41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So after nearly an hour bleeding over a taxi driver&#8217;s front seat whilst he threw me worried looks, asking &#8220;OK?&#8221;, I arrived at Kasih Ibu General Hospital.</p><blockquote name=\"0733\" id=\"0733\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">Finally, I thought, the real treatment can&#160;begin.</blockquote><p name=\"bb39\" id=\"bb39\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Still not knowing for sure whether or not I was going to die (internal bleeding is a thing, right?) I was seen by more nurses and a DR, who poked and prodded me all over, but seemed to refrain from any actual treatment, leaving me pondering:</p><blockquote name=\"beb3\" id=\"beb3\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;When will they sew my finger back&#160;on?&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"75dc\" id=\"75dc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Another hour or so passed, it&#8217;s about 5am, I&#8217;m alone, tired, the pain is starting to set in, and I&#8217;m still bleeding, a lot. Finally the DR returns again, and says I need urgent surgery on my hand (which naturally was no surprise to me at this stage) but being a religious holiday (it seems 95% of days in Bali are religious holidays) the surgeon would not be able to see me until the next day, possibly the day after that.</p><p name=\"72b9\" id=\"72b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Fortunately, the surgeon had taken time out of his holiday to Whatsapp a diagram of his intended procedure from his phone, which I can only describe as the scribbles of a mad-man. I can&#8217;t recall exactly what the picture was now, but if memory serves correctly, it resembled this:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6EtkUDTx7qttJDyuM4DHPA.jpeg\">&#8220;Here&#8217;s the wires and plates the surgeon will put into your hand Mr.&#160;Ryan.&#8221;<p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rksOXcYqwre1KiuhMiQudg.gif\"><p name=\"d47d\" id=\"d47d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I thanked them kindly for their help thus far, and booked a flight to Singapore.</p><p name=\"ec47\" id=\"ec47\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I knew I had a finite amount of time to reattach my finger before it would die. I had sent the picture to a surgeon friend who had already given me odds of 20% that the finger would be saved, so I wasn&#8217;t about to wait another 2 days.</p><p name=\"4993\" id=\"4993\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Within 6 hours I was boarding a plane to Singapore, covered in blood, with my arm in a makeshift cast. The moment I sat down in my seat to the look of horror from the family next to me, I passed out from exhaustion.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ykff7wKgrQebewFSZd8EQw.jpeg\"><p name=\"6445\" id=\"6445\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When I awoke, we had landed. Straight through security, no luggage to collect, I jumped in a taxi. &#8220;Where to?&#8221; the driver needlessly asked. &#8220;Hospital&#8221; I murmured. &#8220;Which one&#8221; he replied. I gave him a look that he correctly interpreted.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p>&#8220;Please state your destination&#8221;<p name=\"b6b4\" id=\"b6b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Things improved dramatically from this point, the level of healthcare in Singapore is fantastic. I shit you not, there are actual robots driving themselves around the hallways.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d_l-KfJMYbb68CF3w6EBUA.gif\"><p name=\"95f4\" id=\"95f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I was seen almost immediately at Changi General Hospital, by numerous specialists. All of whom did a truly terrible job of reassuring me, each one saying things like &#8220;this is actually very bad&#8221; and replying to my questions of &#8220;will my hand be normal again?&#8221; with the philosophical:</p><blockquote name=\"7c4b\" id=\"7c4b\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;What is normal to&#160;you?&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"2d01\" id=\"2d01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Touch&#233; Dr, touch&#233;.</p><p name=\"1b1a\" id=\"1b1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On the plus side, after lots of scans and ultra-sounds they concluded there was no internal bleeding and I wasn&#8217;t going to die.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"5617\" id=\"5617\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After a few hours of different specialists &amp; consultants staring at my finger, they eventually drafted a plan together.</p><p name=\"0df3\" id=\"0df3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;We will admit you to our in-patient ward, and schedule you in for surgery tonight. Our priority is saving the finger, which we will try our best to do, but cannot say for sure if the tip is &#8216;viable&#8217; and whether you will need a skin graft. We&#8217;ll then look at fitting a plate for your 3rd &amp; 4th metacarpal. We suggest a stay of 5 days for the surgery and recovery&#8221;</p><p name=\"1bed\" id=\"1bed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;Great!&#8221; I said, &#8220;whatever you think&#8217;s best&#8221;</p><p name=\"88d1\" id=\"88d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At this point, I was in a wheelchair, with a blanket over my bloody legs, and an IV drip pumping me with pain-killers &amp; antibiotics due to the extremely high risk of infection, as it had already been around 18 hours since the accident and my wounds were still open. But at last there was a plan and I could relax.</p><p name=\"5a75\" id=\"5a75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was wheeled over to the receptionists, where I was shown a screen with my quote for a 5 day stay <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">excluding</strong> the surgery. It was $22,000.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_1VoQ49cbUEPHL7RPsl0og.gif\"><p name=\"e925\" id=\"e925\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It was now that I realised I hadn&#8217;t informed my insurers, it had been the last thing on my mind. Christ, I hadn&#8217;t even told my mum. But I was in Singapore now, my battery was dead, and filling out forms was literally the absolute bottom of my agenda. I handed over my business debit card to pay a deposit and wondered how my accountant would reconcile this expense.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3lG-Ole3t1iMdIZWmaI3Xg.gif\">Make it go&#160;away<p name=\"6140\" id=\"6140\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Later that night, around 3am, I was woken up and carted off for surgery. It was 25 hours after the accident now, and my finger-tip was black. I was awake for this one, but injected multiple times in my hand, so felt no pain. Surgery lasted around 90 minutes. But they managed to save the finger, they were even able to sew my own nail back on.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zkGY2I4QfBD4FuPvx-uhtw.gif\">Mr. Bean gets&#160;it<p name=\"e6df\" id=\"e6df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The following day, they informed me it had been successful, and there was no longer a risk of losing the finger-tip. I would need another operation ASAP to install a small plate into index finger knuckle, as one of the bones had broken off completely and would need to be reattached. They were still unsure whether I would need a plate across my hand for the 3rd &amp; 4th metacarpals, but would make the decision during the next operation.</p><p name=\"e2ee\" id=\"e2ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At this stage, I discharged myself, it seemed unnecessary for to me to stay in their ward using a bed when I could just as easily check in to a hotel. Even if my insurers were going to pay for this, it felt wrong to rack up $22,000 on a hotel bed that I didn&#8217;t need when there were other people waiting.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"cb3a\" id=\"cb3a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I checked into a nearby Holiday Inn for around $100/night. This reduced my hospital bill from $22,000, down to $5,300. Now that I was able to rest, charge my phone and had time to digest the situation, I called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Insure &amp; Go</strong> and informed them. They sent me numerous forms to fill out, which I did with great difficulty using only my left hand. (being right handed)</p><p name=\"39df\" id=\"39df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I gave them every piece of information I could. Was I drunk during the accident? No. Was I wearing a helmet? Yes. Did I hold the relevant licence required? Yes.</p><p name=\"05f6\" id=\"05f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The email back and forth was tedious. Numerous forms, proof of my travel dates, bills from the hospital, x-rays, pictures of my wounds etc etc etc&#8230;</p><p name=\"a9f7\" id=\"a9f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When they asked why I hadn&#8217;t informed them within 24 hours, I explained that it was a chaotic time, I was alone, my battery was dead, I was dying.&#160;<br>The usual reasonable excuses.</p><p name=\"0dc2\" id=\"0dc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a reasonable man, I&#8217;m not claiming for the costs so far, as I didn&#8217;t inform you, I appreciate that, I&#8217;m not claiming for the cost of the bike repair, or the first medical centre bill, the taxis, or the flight to Singapore, or the hospital bill, not even my accommodation.</p><p name=\"044f\" id=\"044f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">All I would like cover for is the next operation on Monday</strong>, which requires me being under general anaesthetic, and will probably cost around $15,000.&#8221; In hindsight, there was no need for me to be reasonable, I was well within my rights to claim for the lot, I had &#163;5m of medical cover after all, as well as &#163;500 of accommodation cover and &#163;10,000 of personal accident cover. But still, I felt inclined to be reasonable.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*O9qWzdsoifZ3TH4zhN-6Rw.gif\"><p name=\"a67b\" id=\"a67b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After more back &amp; forth and days lost over email, I received the below:</p><blockquote name=\"9763\" id=\"9763\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Our medical team believe this injury may require long term care, so we would see if beneficial that you return to the UK for treatment, if you have a pre booked flight home please advise us on the date?
