It seems like most &#8220;digital nomads&#8221; live in Bali, and bounce from villa to villa. I was there for three weeks and really wanted to see what it was like to spend two days in pure luxury with my own pool.&#160;</p><p>I stayed for two nights at <a href=\"https://bali-villasungai.com/\">Villa Sungai</a>, which is&#160;inland about 40 minutes from Seminyak (driving through Canggu). You can easily go from the villa into Canggu, but it rained while we were there and I was so happy to read and play scrabble. I&#8217;d had a lot of beach time already!&#160;</p><p>All meals are served at the villa and there is a menu with Indonesian and Western food. The owner is Australian and the design was done by her. It&#8217;s pretty impeccable.&#160;</p><h2>The rooms (3) at Villa Sungai</h2><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22229\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22231\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>That&#8217;s 3 types of robes&#8230; you know, so that if you want a big fluffy one it&#8217;s there, but if you want a terry cloth one that&#8217;s there too. But then maybe you want a really light one for by the pool so they added it as well!&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22230\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22233\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>The bathroom is huge and outside are two showers and a bathtub.&#160;</p><p>They even fill the tub up with flowers. We drank about a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails each day, so it&#8217;s not like we did nothing (lol) but we mostly just drank, read, and played in the pool.&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22241\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C707&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"707\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22242\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-14.jpg?resize=744%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"744\" height=\"1024\"></p><h2>The Villa Pool &amp; Food</h2><p>The whole villa has three rooms and they look about the same although one is larger than the other two. The decoration is simple and makes it easy to relax. They have TV with a lot of movies as well as music and speakers set up.&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22257\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-29.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>In the main living room there are also speakers set up and an iPod to play with. I plugged my own phone in and used my own music. There is also a game room full of board games and books.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22232\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22255\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-27.jpg?resize=735%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"735\" height=\"1024\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22243\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-15.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22261\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-33.jpg?resize=769%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"769\" height=\"1024\"></p><p>It was a great location, and Tia was traveling with me so we did a little photo shoot for her new summer line.

I didn&#8217;t let myself get my computer out (much) even though the WiFi was great. We ended up watching Lion which was so good and I don&#8217;t think anyone can watch this without crying.&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22248\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-20.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22247\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\"></p><p>In the evenings, they brought us snacks before dinner which they paired with cocktails. The spring rolls, tzatziki dip, and corn fritters were beyond tasty.&#160;</p><p>For dinner, we ate Indonesian meals since we had been eating mostly Western food during our trip. The portions were huge and we never finished anything which I felt guilty about, although we tried.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22259\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-31.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22258\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villa-Sungai-Luxury-Bali-Pool-Villa-30.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Villa Sungai Bali Pool Villa\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\"></p><p>Breakfast was the BEST. This creation is something I haven&#8217;t heard of but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Indonesian. Maybe it&#8217;s Australian? Buttermilk pancakes with creamed corn and bacon&#8230; yeah, really!
