The first goal, and probably most ambitious one, came about in 2003 when <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2010/02/04/the-book-that-continues-to-inspire-my-travels/\">my uncle handed me a magazine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hopping Around The Web</strong></p>\n<p>I also, along with several other digital nomads, recently got to talk tech again with <a href=\"http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/\">Nora Dunn</a> about <a href=\"http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/lifestyle/article/essential-services-for-the-road-nora-dunn\">essential services for the road</a>. I learned a lot by reading the advice from other location independent entrepreneurs and if you&#8217;re looking to run your business from the road you will too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On top of that <a href=\"http://www.heatheronhertravels.com/travel-tips-clean-water-tripbase/\">Heather On Her Travels</a> was kind enough to mention several travel bloggers including myself in an article about a great project from Tripbase. They are donating $1 for every <a href=\"http://www.tripbase.com/travelsecrets/download.do#D3C6A5E9-3DBE-D9FB-C137-5C8E110F4155\">download of their free ebook series</a> and there are some good ones to choose from. Downloading the ebook is free, with no sign up to anything, and Tripbase makes the donation on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For those of you wanting to find some great travel links and sites from around the web, check out frequent commenter <a href=\"https://imambara.blogspot.com/2010/05/splendid-maze-part-1.html\">Anjuli&#8217;s series on her blog</a> (with a very kind <a href=\"https://imambara.blogspot.com/2010/05/splendid-maze-part-2.html\">mention of foXnoMad</a>), and <a href=\"http://twenty-somethingtravel.com/\">Twenty-Something Travel</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://twenty-somethingtravel.com/2010/05/update-links/\">favorite links from May</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>From My Other Blogs</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, you might not make it around to <a href=\"http://www.techguidefortravel.com/\">my</a> <a href=\"http://travelblogadvice.com/\">other</a> <a href=\"http://howtotravelwithpets.com/\">blogs</a> too often or know about them so here are some highlights from the past few months.</p>\n \n<p>Also, for every June post you leave a comment this month, you&#8217;ll be <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2010/06/01/the-best-comments-of-the-month-plus-contest-announcement-may-2010/\">entered to win</a> a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00067L6TQ/ref=nosim/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=foxnomad-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">$15 Amazon gift card</a>.
