We have reflected on how each app affects our processes and implemented what makes our cogs spin without unnecessary hiccups. Since we already went through the trouble of screening most apps aimed at agencies and teams, you might be able to fast forward this dubious process. Keep in mind that while the apps recommended herein work for us, every team has its own set of unique workflows to consider.

In other words, we were quick at laying off Slack internally but haven&#8217;t been able to lay it off for external purposes. It&#8217;s just too convenient. Literally every team has an account there and thus, we handle all client related communication via Slack.</p><p name=\"c616\" id=\"c616\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Before we get to work, it&#8217;s muy important that the client agrees with the direction we want to go. To get on the same page, we share design inspiration until we agree on a general direction and set expectations. We collect and share inspiration via our own internal app. It hasn&#8217;t yet been named but will be available to other teams soon (that&#8217;s right&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I casually dropped our product pitch right there!).</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*J2eHyG51ba0m1k2uPgdZRg.png\"><h3 name=\"b94f\" id=\"b94f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Project and Team management</strong></h3><p name=\"38d1\" id=\"38d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We tried numerous different apps to manage our projects and team before we finally found our groove. We used to work with Slack in combination with either <a href=\"https://basecamp.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Basecamp</a> or <a href=\"https://trello.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a> but with this approach, some features always seemed to be missing. We also realised that separating our internal chat from our management apps wasn&#8217;t a great approach, as toggling between Slack conversations and tasks makes you loose track of the next steps. So we searched long and hard for a replacement until we eventually came upon <a href=\"https://www.getflow.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Flow</a>, an app made by our friends at <a href=\"http://metalab.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Metalab</a> &#128150;</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SRjI-eUUmfXwJgBYlKZwWA.png\"><h3 name=\"6c2e\" id=\"6c2e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Design collaboration</strong></h3><p name=\"69e9\" id=\"69e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In the &#8220;Remote designer&#8217;s hierarchy of needs&#8221; there are three basic tiers. Firstly, our designers need a place to design and prototype our work. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch</a> for product design and<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>depending on client requirements either <a href=\"https://www.flinto.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flinto</a>, <a href=\"http://principle%20prototyping\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Principle</a> or <a href=\"http://framer%20prototype\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Framer</a> for prototyping.</p><p name=\"24ff\" id=\"24ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Secondly, we need a space to collaborate. <a href=\"https://screenhero.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Screenhero</a> lets our designers to doodle on the same computer remotely. At some point, we experimented with a new app called <a href=\"https://www.figma.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a>. It holds some impressive technology and should, in theory, replace both Sketch and Screenhero. Unfortunately the app is still in an early stage and since 3drops&#8217; juice gets squeezed in the design process, we weren&#8217;t keen on switching out that entire workflow. Yet.</p><p name=\"cf76\" id=\"cf76\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thirdly! We need a place to share our designs and collect feedback. We specifically use <a href=\"https://redpen.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Redpen</a> for client feedback because they get it (hint: did you also experience the recently recurrent server failures on Redpen? That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re about to launch a new feedback tool and save everyone from the headache of failing apps&#8212; because we&#8217;re worth it. That&#8217;s another product pitch by the way, sneakily inserted here. And while this parentheses keeps getting longer you&#8217;re probably wondering what the hell is going on. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll put an end to it now. Ha! Fooled you, I&#8217;m still going. That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m out). Internally, we prefer <a href=\"https://www.abstractapp.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Abstract</a> to feedback as the app also manages our design files, making it much easier for any of our designers to pick up the work from someone else. Abstract basically replaces Dropbox for managing files, it improves our design collaboration while providing a great solution for internal feedback. Kudos to them!</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZwAup7N2_CZg5y0fKJKWfg.png\"><h3 name=\"fd7c\" id=\"fd7c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Dev collaboration</strong></h3><p name=\"2895\" id=\"2895\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\">&#8220;In the country of blind, the one-eyed man is king&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;right? When it comes to dev collaboration, there isn&#8217;t really an alternative to <a href=\"https://github.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>. It does the job and it does it well. Our developers use Github to review each others work, similar to how our designers use Abstract.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*psAiQyg-jkE-3VZYn2FFSg.png\"><h3 name=\"fcab\" id=\"fcab\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Conference calls &amp; Client presentations</strong></h3><p name=\"8206\" id=\"8206\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We handle all conference calls on <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Hangout</a> because face to face interaction is a necessity. Hangout is wildly popular, but it has with a few shortcomings. It&#8217;s sometimes appears to be incompatible with Google Chrome (weird!) and it comes with a fierce energy consumption that will crash or permanently harm your computer. That said, we&#8217;re waiting for someone to disrupt the video call industry and we are on the lookout for a new app. Preferably nothing too corporate like Bluejeans or the like. If you know of any, feel free to leave a comment!</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oTjhwICVyAnXc1obWSHo4Q.png\"><h3 name=\"3c44\" id=\"3c44\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Project planning &amp; Team forecasting</strong></h3><p name=\"01d7\" id=\"01d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Lastly, we have been on a lookout for a project planning and team forecasting app for some time. It&#8217;s easy to stare yourself blind on tasks in a list or kanban view, but however long your stare, the larger picture rarely submerges. So we embarked on a journey to find a suitable app only to realise that the marketing is littered with apps trying to solve this problem. We tried them all, but none felt right. They were complicated and packed with features we didn&#8217;t want. So we decided to get our hands dirty and build an app on our own (Whoa whoa whoa&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;a third time? Really! This article is turning into a cheap sales pitch).</p><p name=\"5fab\" id=\"5fab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We imagined an app with two sides: One side that shows all our projects, their status and who&#8217;s working where. Another side where we see the entire team&#8217;s schedules in one view, giving us the ability to &#8220;glimpse into the future&#8221; and plan accordingly. These sides would add a lot of zen to project planning and resource forecasting, which otherwise is associated with anxiety and sad faces. We simply call our app <a href=\"https://onroadmap.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roadmap</a>, and it will be available publicly in a few weeks! &#9728;&#65039;</p><p name=\"ea78\" id=\"ea78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I hope this article is useful to someone out there.
