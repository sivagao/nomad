It ties in well with <a href=\"http://levels.io/the-wests-unemployment-problem-is-permanent/\">Robert Peston's documentary on the European crisis</a>.</p> <p>The first episode manages to trackback 1997's Asian Financial Crisis and the 2008 Worldwide Financial Crisis back to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand\">Ayn Rand</a>'s philosophies of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)\">objectivism</a>. Rand's ideas dictate that everyone should simply be a rational actor doing what's best for themselves, and in effect that will be best decision for all people. </p> <p>The documentary shows how this philosophy has been interwoven into America's fiscal policies affecting the entire world for the last decades through Alan Greenspan's decisions, but how it actually doesn't always bode for everyone in reality.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>P.S.
