It is something we cannot escape. As we cross each new threshold we evolve towards new beginnings.</p><p name=\"aa13\" id=\"aa13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Growing up in the ideal town of Santa Barbara, California was perfect, until I was up-rooted at age 16 with a move to a Native American village in the far northern wilds of Alaska.</p><p name=\"e863\" id=\"e863\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My father worked at a government base 200 miles from Russia. This is where I spent my last year of high school in a classroom with 12 native Eskimos.</p><p name=\"7537\" id=\"7537\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There, at 17, I was noticed, coveted and &#8220;claimed&#8221; by a powerful Mafioso 20 years older than me.</p><p name=\"a1d5\" id=\"a1d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He was infamous, as one of the most powerful men in America. He had the power to decide which companies would get the multi-million contracts for building the Alaskan oil pipeline.</p><p name=\"4c6f\" id=\"4c6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He saw me, coveted me and decided I would be his wife. My life quickly became a fast lane to chaos; politics and uncertainty.</p><p name=\"265d\" id=\"265d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By the time I turned 21, I had given birth to three children.</p><p name=\"08eb\" id=\"08eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My world came to an end when my two-year-old son was killed. That same night our house was burned to the ground, in a Mafia deal gone bad.</p><p name=\"4756\" id=\"4756\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How does one deal with such deep loss? My heart said, &#8220;God please take me, and stop this torture.&#8221; Over the course of many months I passed through different stages of wanting to live or to die. My heart was dead. The emptiness was so incredibly deep. I went inward to seek spiritual peace.</p><p name=\"c677\" id=\"c677\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had to leave this marriage. But, I was filled with fear and uncertainty. It took another five years to gain the courage&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;then, I escaped.</p><blockquote name=\"7e73\" id=\"7e73\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #1</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"939b\" id=\"939b\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote\">&#8221;When the pain of the problem becomes greater than the pain of the solution is when you&#8217;ll take action.&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"6bff\" id=\"6bff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">I left with my two young girls and little funds just to be free. I did not fight over the enormous amounts of money that I could have gone after.</p><p name=\"a02d\" id=\"a02d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I cannot accurately describe the fear in making this decision&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;just to leave, let alone fighting over money.</p><p name=\"97a4\" id=\"97a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You cannot just end a mafia marriage, there are all kinds of repercussions including the fact that the man believes he owns the children.</p><p name=\"66d7\" id=\"66d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had a do or die feeling in my gut. I was not strong&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I was very weak and na&#239;ve with no inner power or essence, as I was not allowed to work, pursue a career or find myself in any way.</p><p name=\"e073\" id=\"e073\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was miserable, even though I had luxury and money. But I had no interest in money as I had no spirit or life in me.</p><p name=\"1d48\" id=\"1d48\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And, I left it all behind.</p><p name=\"06f3\" id=\"06f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Starting Over</strong></p><blockquote name=\"4b44\" id=\"4b44\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #2</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"2c4a\" id=\"2c4a\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">I discovered that taking the first step is what frees you. It can be so fucking scary, but once you make the choice, you get stronger by the minute.</blockquote><p name=\"68cd\" id=\"68cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">To start a new life, I invested the small pittance I saved and bought ten acres of raw land in Arizona for about $5000 down.</p><p name=\"cdfc\" id=\"cdfc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Go figure!</p><p name=\"2828\" id=\"2828\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had no formal education beyond high school, but I was immersed in the world of the best &#8220;deal makers&#8221; out there, so all I knew was to go out and &#8220;do a deal.&#8221;</p><p name=\"cc27\" id=\"cc27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I built a subdivision.</p><p name=\"8fc3\" id=\"8fc3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The land I bought did not even have water! I had to bring in the water lines and build a road.</p><p name=\"1dba\" id=\"1dba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This became my first entrepreneurial venture.</p><p name=\"0899\" id=\"0899\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I financed the build out by selling lots. It became highly profitable.</p><p name=\"ea2f\" id=\"ea2f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My ascent into freedom became literal as well as figurative. I did not know what I was doing, but moved forward in little baby steps every day.</p><blockquote name=\"783d\" id=\"783d\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #3</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"b405\" id=\"b405\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">Move forward in baby steps when you need to&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;but whatever you do, just keep moving forward.</blockquote><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lTsZuX9NDuDaGfLNjMdYtQ.jpeg\">Flying with Kool&#160;News<p name=\"29fe\" id=\"29fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I took up skydiving.</p><p name=\"0851\" id=\"0851\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then, I leased the airport and started a skydiving school. I was 24.</p><p name=\"aed5\" id=\"aed5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was determined not to fail. After all, my husband said I would never make it and that I would be back within six months.</p><blockquote name=\"3dc1\" id=\"3dc1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #4</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"93ae\" id=\"93ae\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">I became a master of observation. I saw how other people would think and talk about an idea, then &#8220;get ready forever&#8221; and never accomplish their dreams. I was determined not to go down that road.</blockquote><p name=\"4fd9\" id=\"4fd9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Skydiving was way beyond my comfort zone. I had a lot of fear and was totally out of my league. But, my spirit did not want to give up.</p><p name=\"cdf7\" id=\"cdf7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My fear and intimidation of what I could do or not do was always with me. I learned that managing fear was partly about seeing the message that fear brings to you.</p><p name=\"d55d\" id=\"d55d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is said that everywhere one goes and everything one does propels a person to where they&#8217;re supposed to be. The unknowns of the frontiers I embarked on came with great risk, but also great reward. I used pain to push me forward.</p><p name=\"80b3\" id=\"80b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An extreme life will take you in and spit you out. This kind of journey makes you very honest with yourself. Whether having success or experiencing a failure, I studied the cause and the effects of both. I became a scholar learning the alchemy of the internal martial arts and strategies.</p><p name=\"95bb\" id=\"95bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I started studying the Taoist philosophies and began to find my inner warrior. I learned how to bring my mind into my body with power and clarity.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*AaX1kk4iJFOfkSDDhA4Cqg.jpeg\">Maria Camille in Oak Creek Canyon - Sedona,&#160;Arizona<p name=\"2030\" id=\"2030\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This energy became the fuel that started the foundation for new adventures.</p><p name=\"0dd6\" id=\"0dd6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I became a pioneer in extreme sports.</p><p name=\"6d9b\" id=\"6d9b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With skydiving, I took interest in the Style competition, which is gymnastics at 200 mph with only 26 seconds of free-fall airtime.</p><p name=\"6328\" id=\"6328\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I won a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team and went on to win four gold medals and a bronze in the World Skydiving Championships, the first American woman to do so.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d7HKswtM0Agf7pBMFytnyg.jpeg\">World Championships in Guidonia, Italy<p name=\"bed3\" id=\"bed3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Fully out of the box that had defined my existence, I excelled in other extreme sports. The changes in my life were dichotomous and I found I had a knack for the perilous.</p><p name=\"7a3a\" id=\"7a3a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On icy 45 degree mountain slopes, I competed in giant slalom ski racing and parachuting accuracy in the Para-ski competitions. My reinvention paid off again in a trio of National Championships.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N8JIZv_e6Z4Deu79JVys4g.jpeg\">Para-Ski Competition<p name=\"1c90\" id=\"1c90\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In the midst of these successes, tragedy struck again. The home I built on my subdivision was burned down&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;dashing my dreams and depleting my finances to nothing. I found out later that my ex-mafia husband had it burned down&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;how dare me become successful!</p><p name=\"8b9f\" id=\"8b9f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I lost everything&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;again!</p><blockquote name=\"3ed4\" id=\"3ed4\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #5</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"9cb8\" id=\"9cb8\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">Tragedy always brings about change. It happens like a large space, which opens up so you can fill it with something new. And, to fill the space requires the courage to let go of certainties. I learned to not become attached to owning &#8220;things.&#8221;</blockquote><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*--9C7fmuzmS_1aJVs27mJg.jpeg\">World Meet Competition on the U.S. Parachute Team<p name=\"5c85\" id=\"5c85\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I continued traveling with the U.S. Parachute Team competing in world competitions. After years of competing and traveling, I had no desire to stop and settle into a normal routine&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;which is called &#8220;getting a JOB.&#8221;</p><p name=\"b798\" id=\"b798\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I started living the life of the nomad, seeking the unknown, blazing new trails and making new discoveries long before &#8220;nomad&#8221; was acceptable.</p><p name=\"5e00\" id=\"5e00\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was growing an entrepreneurial spirit, and started working different gigs and starting cool ventures and adventures worldwide.</p><p name=\"104c\" id=\"104c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I failed often.</strong></p><p name=\"8897\" id=\"8897\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Failures became like the mystical sage teaching me lessons. I grew depth through living karmas of lifetimes.</p><p name=\"79d8\" id=\"79d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After some years, a glimpse of a powerful new me started to form.</p><p name=\"2260\" id=\"2260\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Although I was young, dharma was already teaching me old age. I was inheriting an old soul spirit.</p><p name=\"e685\" id=\"e685\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If I had stayed in one place&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;got a job and tried to live normal, I would never of learned the deepest lessons and gained the depth.</p><p name=\"6373\" id=\"6373\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I lived my entrepreneurial ventures. To date, I&#8217;ve started 15 business ventures across 20 countries.

You need to keep walking through them and not worry about where it all ends up.</blockquote><p name=\"f356\" id=\"f356\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Challenges became my teacher. I developed the fighters heart.</p><p name=\"ae6a\" id=\"ae6a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I decided that giving up would never be my style. I could try and live with more certainty, but that was like being in a box, one can stay there, but I thought it was a complete waste of time.</p><blockquote name=\"2845\" id=\"2845\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Lesson #7</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"95d1\" id=\"95d1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">I think lives become like a battlefield from the fear one feels when they have not developed their inner essence and power. This battleground becomes a major energy drain. Learn to use fear to fuel your spirit and keep moving forward.</blockquote><p name=\"77eb\" id=\"77eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">As I competed in a dangerous sport, the thought of death was there each time I jumped out of the airplane.</p><p name=\"c866\" id=\"c866\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Through the fear of dying, (which I did have) I learned to accept it and manage it.</p><p name=\"fdaf\" id=\"fdaf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">It&#8217;s called focus.</strong></p><p name=\"8814\" id=\"8814\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I learned that pain and challenges would not destroy me. I am glad to have paid my dues.</p><p name=\"3754\" id=\"3754\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There is no better way to find your inner strength than to head into the unknown. The warrior receives their power in the unknown.</p><p name=\"10d6\" id=\"10d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you contemplate that big change in life&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;like the scariest thing you are facing, well, I think this is the time you should go travel. Alone!</p><p name=\"d1e9\" id=\"d1e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once my high-adrenaline pursuits had ended, I realized the true essence of my journey emanated from the experiences which were achieved through falling and rising; from failing and then achieving new learning. That is what mastery is built on and where the alchemy of knowledge comes from.</p><p name=\"5a38\" id=\"5a38\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Through many diverse experiences, the raw reality of survival in tough situations brings out the soul&#8217;s fundamental strengths and weaknesses.
