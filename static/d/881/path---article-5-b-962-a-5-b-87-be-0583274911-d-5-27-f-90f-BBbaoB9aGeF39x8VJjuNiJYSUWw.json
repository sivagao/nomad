Sometimes, for Indians, getting a visa can be such an issue that it can mess up their travel plans completely. This tool I&#8217;m introducing is a &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.expedia.co.in/vc/cheap-hotels/visa-free-for-indians/index.html\"><strong>Visa Free Tool for Indians</strong></a>&#8221; which helps Indians choose destinations they don&#8217;t need a visa to and can travel to without hassle- then gives them all the practical tips useful to Indians in&#160;that destination.</p><h2>Example of the Visa Free tool for Indian travelers</h2><p>So, let&#8217;s take Thailand for example.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17960\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-23-at-4.52.57-PM.jpg?resize=560%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Awesome Travel Resource for Indian Travelers\" width=\"560\" height=\"319\">The first thing it shows you is the basic information, which is always the most important, like how long you can stay in the country. Although this is a &#8220;visa free&#8221; tool it still shows the places the offer Indians a simple Visa on Arrival, which is really more like an entry fee. It tells you the price of the Visa on Arrival. It reminds you to do this when you enter (as in if you come through Bangkok to another city, you&#8217;ll pay this in Bangkok). It needs paid in Thai currency, so you can pull out the money in the ATM on arrival or use your card. It also tells the currency and festivals.</p><p>Next you can search by place within Thailand, so let&#8217;s take <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/koh-samui-nightlife/\"><strong>Koh Samui</strong></a> as an example, which is a place I love. You can see the climate, best time to visit, attractions, and where to eat.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17961\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-23-at-4.53.05-PM.jpg?resize=560%2C329&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Awesome Travel Resource for Indian Travelers\" width=\"560\" height=\"329\">You see local food and Indian food, since we all miss our home cooked meals when we are away. As a American blogger in India, I tend to point out American style food in my blog posts while I travel, so this is just the same same but different, as we say in India.</p><h3>For other useful tips for Indians traveling abroad check out:</h3><p>There are more like this on each of those blogs if you continue clicking around. If you&#8217;re an Indian reader checking this out,&#160;I hope that this tool can help you find somewhere easy to go on your next trip!</p><h3>Pin this travel resource for Indian travelers&#160;for later:</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17962\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/india-visa-free-travel.jpg?resize=512%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Awesome Travel Resource for Indian Travelers\" width=\"512\" height=\"768\"></p><p>Did you enjoy this post?
