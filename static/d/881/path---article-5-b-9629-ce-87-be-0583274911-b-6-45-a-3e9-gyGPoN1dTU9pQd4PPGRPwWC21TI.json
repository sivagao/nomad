But while you may be tempted to unleash your impulsive side and board the next plane to Monteverde without so much as an inkling as to what to once you step foot in Costa Rica, it&#8217;s always important to have a plan established first.</p><p>Whenever I travel, I have a checklist of essentials I abide by that help me prepare myself for my new journeys ahead. Make sure you have the following necessities ready to go, too.</p><ul><li class=\"li1\"><p class=\"s2\"><b>Updated passports &#8212; </b>to avoid delays at the airport, maintain an up-to-date passport for simple transportation.<br> </p></li><li><strong>Visa &#8211;&#160;</strong>Check if your nationality needs a visa.

But when it comes to navigating my way to Costa Rica, I always choose to arrive at my desired destination in the two following ways:<b></b></p><h3>Via Plane</h3><p>One of the most common (and perhaps easiest) ways to travel to the country is via plane. If you depart from another country, it may just be your most practical &#8212; and only &#8212; option.</p><p>Be sure to research your local airport options and choose the flight package that best suits you. Check for flights on <a href=\"http://www.kiwi.com/deep?affilid=hippieinheels\">kiwi.com</a> &#8211; my favorite flight search engine.</p><h3><p class=\"s3\"><b>By Public Transportation</b></p></h3><p>If you find yourself visiting a different Central American country and want to save yourself the cost of a plane ticket, consider opting to travel via a form of public transportation instead.</p><p>When I travel, I often make it a point to explore nearby countries and regions before I return home &#8212; which is how I found myself in Costa Rica during my first time visiting the country.</p><p>I originally planned a trip to Panama, but had an urge to explore the lands of the nearby Monteverde forest, too. The only thing separating me from my journeys was <a href=\"http://traveltips.usatoday.com/costa-rica-bus-travel-panama-1134.html\">a bus ticket and a day&#8217;s worth of travel</a> before I could initiate my new adventures in this fun and exciting land.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27227\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-costa-rica-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Where to go in Costa Rica | A Complete Guide to Costa Rica\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p><h2><b>My Go-To Spots in Costa Rica (That I Think You Should Visit, Too!)</b></h2><p>If you crave adventures and love experiencing a new set of unique surroundings every day, then you may just fall in love with Costa Rica in the same way that I did during my travels.</p><p>They call Costa Rica <a href=\"http://happyplanetindex.org/countries/costa-rica\">the land of happiness</a> for a reason, after all. There&#8217;s plenty to see and do &#8212; so you&#8217;ll never have to worry about leaving the land without a satisfied sense of adventure and a heart full of memories.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a list of my top Costa Rican travel activities and top spots to visit that you should experience for yourself during your stay, too.<b><br> </b></p><h2>Adventure in Costa Rica</h2><h3><p class=\"s2\"><p class=\"s2\"><b>Zip lining over the Rio Celeste Waterfall&#160;</b></p></p></h3><p>Costa Rica is a nation beaming with natural wildlife and it dedicated to preserving its precious environment, too. Because Costa Rica is <a href=\"https://greenglobaltravel.com/ecotourism-in-costa-rica/\">one of the world&#8217;s top ecotourism destinations</a>, expect to enjoy the biodiversity without altering it in the process.</p><p>But just because Costa Rica emphasizes protected environmental activities doesn&#8217;t mean that they can&#8217;t be fun and exciting, too. My favorite activity is enjoying the view of the country &#8212; from a zip line, of course. There&#8217;s nothing more refreshing than immersing yourself in nature while enjoying the kick of an adrenaline rush, too.<b><br> </b></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27224\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-costa-rica-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Where to go in Costa Rica | A Complete Guide to Costa Rica\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\"></p><h3><p class=\"s2\"><p class=\"s2\"><b>Snorkeling in the Cahuita</b></p></p></h3><p>I&#8217;m a sucker for a beautiful body of water &#8212; a feature which Costa Rica certainly doesn&#8217;t fail to deliver.</p><p>The entire country is beaming with biodiversity and I always find myself fascinated by the new species I have the fortune of discovering during my stays. Be sure to dive into the country &#8212; literally &#8212; when you travel. Suit yourself up with your best snorkeling attire and explore the majestic seas.<b><br> </b></p><h3><p class=\"s2\"><p class=\"s2\"><b>Whale watching in Tamarindo</b></p></p></h3><p>When I&#8217;m back at home, it&#8217;s not uncommon for me to go days without seeing another species &#8212; besides that of humans, of course. Yet the world is so rich and diverse that I always have a sense of longing to enjoy the company of another animal or ocean-dwelling friend.</p><p>I always make a point to enjoy the exotic parrots in the forests, take in the scenery of the beautiful tree frogs, and indulge in a bit of whale watching, too.<b><br> </b></p><p>Check out all the best day tours in Costa Rica on <a href=\"https://www.partner.viator.com/en/23583/Costa-Rica/d747-ttd\">Viator</a>, who offer amazing deals and have user reviews.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27223\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-costa-rica-2.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Where to go in Costa Rica | A Complete Guide to Costa Rica\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\"></p><h2 class=\"p1\"><p class=\"s6\"><b>Where to Stay in Costa Rica</b></p></h2><p>Whenever I travel, I always emphasize the importance of my living arrangements. I may spend the entire day exploring my new surroundings, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t need a comfortable place to refresh in during my time in between activities, too.</p><p>While there are a variety of options when it comes to how you choose to experience your stay, I find that hotels are always my preferred option. It&#8217;s nice to camp in the great outdoors, but I also have a preference for a touch of luxury during my voyages as well.</p><p>While I may go against the popular opinion, I really enjoy removing myself from the bustle and crowded areas of popular tourist destinations &#8212; which makes Manuel Antonio the perfect place.</p><p>I&#8217;ve traveled to Costa Rica a handful of times already, and each stay was in a private suite nestled in the comforts of Villa Punto De Vista &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.villapuntodevista.com/best-things-around-manuel-antonio-costa-rica/\">a local hotel located near outdoor activities</a>, beaches, and more!</p><p>Be sure to choose a hotel or living arrangement surrounded by plenty of outdoor fun and activities that enhance your overall stay.<b><br> </b></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27228\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-costa-rica-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Where to go in Costa Rica | A Complete Guide to Costa Rica\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><h2><p class=\"s6\"><b>Tasting Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine</b></p></h2><p>What would a trip to Costa Rica be without a bit of tasty food &#8212; or comida rica, as the natives like to say?</p><p>I always strive to push myself out of my comfort zone when I travel &#8212; starting with the dishes I eat throughout the day. I can effortlessly get a burger and fries back home, so why not indulge in a tasty gallo pinto instead?</p><p>Remember to check out local restaurants and try a few bites of street food, too. You may taste <a href=\"https://costa-rica-guide.com/travel/food/sopa-negra-recipe/\">a delicious bowl of sopa negra</a> &#8212; the country&#8217;s designated black bean soup &#8212; and make it your next go-to dish you plan to bring back home.</p><h2><p class=\"s6\"><b>Experience Costa Rica&#8217;s Beauty Firsthand</b></p><p class=\"s2\"><br> </p></h2><p>Costa Rica is a land brimming with natural wildlife, beautiful scenery, and delicious cuisines. But don&#8217;t just take my word for it &#8212;&#160; plan your own journeys to the land of &#8220;pura vida&#8221; so you can experience the adventures of Costa Rica, too.</p><h3>Pin Where to go in Costa Rica for later:</h3><p>&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-27226 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-costa-rica-5.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Kacey Bradley is the lifestyle and travel blogger for <a href=\"http://driftercollective.com/\">The Drifter Collective</a>, an eclectic lifestyle blog that expresses various forms of style through the influence of culture and the world around us.
