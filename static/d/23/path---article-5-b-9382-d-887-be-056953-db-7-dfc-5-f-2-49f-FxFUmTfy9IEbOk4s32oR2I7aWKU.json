There are many more who deserve to be in this article. This will likely be a series of sorts, so stay tuned.</p><h3 name=\"4add\" id=\"4add\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Sarah (@rifkegribenes)</strong></h3><p name=\"3392\" id=\"3392\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Country:</strong> USA</p><p name=\"1c94\" id=\"1c94\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Admirable traits</strong>: dependable, highly professional, kind, excellent communicator, gets stuff done</p><p name=\"fcfd\" id=\"fcfd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In short: if Sarah is on your team and you put in the effort, you&#8217;re likely to have a quality project in your portfolio. Not only is she a skilled graphic designer, but she&#8217;s also a consistent communicator, tenacious coder, and has a bias for getting stuff done.</p><p name=\"63ad\" id=\"63ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">She&#8217;s currently finishing up Chingu&#8217;s first nonprofit project for an Italian blood donor clinic with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jayullman\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Ullman</a>, as well as in the latter stages of what might be the most ambitious Build-to-Learn project to date.</p><p name=\"3cc9\" id=\"3cc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you ever land on a team with Sarah, here is the appropriate reaction:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><h3 name=\"e1ff\" id=\"e1ff\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Daniel Segovia</strong> (@dsegovia90)</h3><p name=\"3fd8\" id=\"3fd8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Country</strong>: Mexico</p><p name=\"dc2d\" id=\"dc2d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Admirable traits</strong>: calm kindness, highly adaptable, top-notch people skills, flat-out ships projects.</p><p name=\"c00e\" id=\"c00e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Daniel is 3 for 3 in completing build-to-learn projects, and in each project he adapted to whatever the project needed to be finished. I can&#8217;t adequately express how valuable of a trait that is to have in a team-mate.</p><p name=\"aad3\" id=\"aad3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The first project his team-mates disappeared and he put the entire project on his back and finished it himself (if you&#8217;re in the current Voyage, you&#8217;ve probably seen the immensely popular team-name generator bot, Temere, that&#8217;s the project he made).</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QopA_EAHEoYib2Wk20Y40g.png\"><p name=\"c776\" id=\"c776\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The second project was the awesome pair-programming bot, which he built with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@agathalynn\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">Abigail (agathalynn)</a>. He also goes to bat for his team-mates. I once talked with Dan about an ambitious project and he flat out said &#8220;If I were to choose a team, I would try my hardest to get Abigail on it.&#8221;</p><p name=\"60cf\" id=\"60cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The third project he was a PM and took on a more mentorship role, and of course the project was completed and is awesome (shoutout to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jdrichardstech\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">JD Richards</a> b/c he really shined on this project).</p><p name=\"dad3\" id=\"dad3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Dan is working on another ambitious project now and like all projects he takes on, it will be finished. And then he will undoubtedly get a dev job (if he wants one), so sadly for future Chingus, you may not get the opportunity to work with Dan for awhile.</p><p name=\"3996\" id=\"3996\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But if you do, here is a reasonable reaction:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><h3 name=\"ea6e\" id=\"ea6e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Periklis <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">(@periman)</strong></h3><p name=\"a67e\" id=\"a67e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Admirable traits</strong>: kind leader, patience, optimism, infectious curiosity, goes on wild learning adventures</p><p name=\"c129\" id=\"c129\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Country:</strong> Greece</p><p name=\"f860\" id=\"f860\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Whenever writing about Periman, I have trouble not sounding hyperbolic. He&#8217;s that good. He has helped so many people in the cohorts, whether it be inspiring others with his ambitious projects, being a Project Manager for teams that ship, or helping with code or job advice.</p><p name=\"3478\" id=\"3478\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you ask past team-mates about Periman, there&#8217;s often a sort of emotional-quality to their response.</p><p name=\"ae39\" id=\"ae39\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They might talk about a time when held a meeting at a time that was convenient for his team (but 2am his time).</p><p name=\"8af3\" id=\"8af3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They might mention long talks about wide-ranging topics, both programming-related and life-related.</p><p name=\"9e0b\" id=\"9e0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They might talk about hours he spent patiently helping them with coding challenges.</p><p name=\"7a86\" id=\"7a86\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unwavering positivity and an infectious curiosity&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;that&#8217;s Periman in a few words. But I&#8217;ll leave a direct message Periman sent me not too long ago that&#8217;ll give you a better sense of why he deserves to be in this article.</p><blockquote name=\"2396\" id=\"2396\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;I started since last month doing private lessons to a few chingu members that don&#8217;t know js well yet&#160;. Since I don&#8217;t have time for chingu projects ( I have 2 huge enterprise ones on my back at work). So I thought I would invest some time this way. Should I open a channel for people willing to invest time in the same way I do&#160;? Do you know if there are any here in Chingu?&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"9fea\" id=\"9fea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">p.s. Periman&#8217;s signed up for Voyage-2&#8230;</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><h3 name=\"c767\" id=\"c767\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Nat (@nat)</strong></h3><p name=\"3248\" id=\"3248\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Admirable traits</strong>: passionate coder, incredible energy, tireless work ethic, takes pride in her work, commitment to shipping</p><p name=\"66aa\" id=\"66aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Country: Russia</strong></p><p name=\"59da\" id=\"59da\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nat is the kind of person who when she joins a project, she goes all in for her team.</p><p name=\"9a67\" id=\"9a67\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nat is the kind of team-mate that will push you to get you out of your comfort zone (which is here real developer growth happens).</p><p name=\"1c41\" id=\"1c41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You&#8217;ll also likely get a real sense of what it feels like to work in a professional software team. Bi-weekly check-ins, github etiquette, individual code reviews before merging (which she personally spends extra hours doing to help her team-mates improve).</p><p name=\"875a\" id=\"875a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have learned so much from her and she is single-handedly setting the tone and pace for what a Build-to-Learn team should look like. Her commitment is inspiring and if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have her on your team, the only reaction that makes sense is this:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><h3 name=\"f3e6\" id=\"f3e6\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Kim (@kimkwanka)</h3><p name=\"9df6\" id=\"9df6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Country:</strong> Germany</p><p name=\"0b61\" id=\"0b61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Admirable traits</strong>: dependable, fun, will challenge you, harasses Jim (;p)</p><p name=\"d883\" id=\"d883\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kim is a magician&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;simple as that. I have written about Kim before and I will write about Kim in the future. She&#8217;s just that kind of team-mate, developer and person.</p><p name=\"0153\" id=\"0153\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kim can join even a faltering team and instantly change the dynamic with her work ethic. She brings a perfect storm to any team she is on: humour, a remarkable curiosity, and an unwavering bias to get in the editor and code.</p><p name=\"0411\" id=\"0411\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Ask anyone on the DevGaido team (and likely anyone who has been on a team with her), they&#8217;ll tell you how unlikely it is to be able to find a better team-mate.</p><p name=\"d30c\" id=\"d30c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kim&#8217;s working on the massive DevGaido project, so you aren&#8217;t likely to work with her unless you work on that, but if it ever does happen here is the only appropriate response:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p></div>","title":"If you ever get one these 5 Chingus on your team, you just hit the remote dev jackpot"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382d887be056953db7dfc"}}
