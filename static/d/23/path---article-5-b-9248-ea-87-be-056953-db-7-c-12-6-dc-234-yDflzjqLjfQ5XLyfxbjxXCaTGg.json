I quickly tried to figure out where I could work comfortably on my MacBook. I knew I was not going to work in coffee places like many people do. Too crowdy, too noisy and their WiFi is usually a challenge on its own.</p> <p>I knew co-working spaces were starting to pop up everwhere but I had never considered them before. Why? Well, in Amsterdam co-working spaces seem to be filled with hypey wannabe startup folk building \"the next Facebook For Dogs with GroupOn Deals\". In Amsterdam everyone can get great WiFi at home and work from there. So there's no use for co-working spaces to me. In addition, the actual startup community is loosely dispersed around the city and doesn't stick to one venue.</p> <img class=\"sl_lazyimg\" alt=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" width=\"100%\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/streetfood2.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>Now in Bangkok, things are quite different. First of all, since it's less developed, much of the city is messy (from the perspective of a Westerner), there's not many good places to work and there's a good chance the quality of WiFi at your home in Bangkok is too low. In addition, the startup 'community' is actually concentrated at the co-working spaces.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-723 responsively-lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/inside-hubba.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>I browsed around the terrific <a href=\"http://www.sharedesk.net/\">ShareDesk</a>, which provides a listing of co-working spaces around the world. </p> <img src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1794.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1794\" width=\"100%\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-884 responsively-lazy\"> <p>One of the best co-working spaces I found in Bangkok was <a href=\"http://hubbathailand.com/\">HUBBA</a>. I visited HUBBA on my second day here and everyone was surprised I had only arrived yesterday and had already found them! Since my goal is to work here and I didn't have space for downtime, I needed to find something like this quickly.</p> <img class=\"sl_lazyimg\" alt=\"\" src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" width=\"100%\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/space-1-1024x640.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>Their office is in the same street as the Swedish Embassy which gives you kind of an idea of how it might look.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-725 responsively-lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hubba920.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>It actually feels like you are working in an isolated part of Thailand (just like an embassy). </p> <img src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1795.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-857 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It's clean, has amazing air-conditioning (very necessary at 40C/100F temperatures), has 100 Mbps WiFi that is 5 times faster (!) than my connection used to be in Amsterdam.</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-724 responsively-lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HUBBA-Team.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>HUBBA features a mix of mostly Thai and some westerners. The team is made up of really sweet people and they even serve you street food daily for lunch and dinner!</p> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-795 responsively-lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2036-1024x764.jpg\" width=\"100%\"> <p>They advertise a 100mbps download speed, but it's actually more like 20mbps.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"2702972223\" width=\"300\" height=\"135\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-888 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"https://levels.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2702972223.png\" alt=\"2702972223\" width=\"300\" height=\"135\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-888\"> <p>Another space in Bangkok is <strong>Launchpad</strong> which seem good too, <a href=\"/co-working-spaces-in-bangkok-launchpad\">I'll visit them next week &#187;</a></p> <p>P.S.
