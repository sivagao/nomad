As a new mom I had no idea what to expect as far as what my maternity leave needs would be, so I asked every entrepreneur mom I could find what I should do. Based on their advice, I decided to take 3 months off entirely after my son was born. (Yes, ENTIRELY!)</p><p name=\"2925\" id=\"2925\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My son was born Jan on 30th, 2015. Here&#8217;s what our growth looked like while I was on leave:</p><p name=\"807d\" id=\"807d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">February: $74,489 MRR</p><p name=\"78f7\" id=\"78f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">March: $93,704 MRR</p><p name=\"9d18\" id=\"9d18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">April $109,858 MRR</p><p name=\"5600\" id=\"5600\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">During the 3 months I was on leave we cracked the $100k monthly recurring mark, the $1m annual recurring mark and our MRR increased by 47%!</strong></p><p name=\"216c\" id=\"216c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So do I have a team that I totally trust, who definitely doesn&#8217;t need my poking and prodding to do amazing work and grow our company? I think that&#8217;s some pretty strong evidence that the answer is yes.</p><h4 name=\"1388\" id=\"1388\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The first step to building a team that you trust is to only hire people that you trust. A LOT. From day&#160;one.</h4><p name=\"cd79\" id=\"cd79\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As soon as trust is lost, you can&#8217;t have a working relationship with that person. People have said to me about their employees, &#8220;I think she&#8217;s stealing from me,&#8221; or, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s just messing around on facebook all day and not doing any real work.&#8221; (This is especially common on distributed teams like ours.)</p><p name=\"38f4\" id=\"38f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Are you kidding me??? If you really don&#8217;t trust an employee, you need to end that relationship right now!</p><p name=\"caa7\" id=\"caa7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is a two-way street, by the way&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I&#8217;m also shocked to learn how often employees put up with late paychecks, horrible treatment, and blatant lies from their bosses. Who wants to work like that?</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4GqZDgHgzC0gNT5jNB-L9A.jpeg\">Team Edgar, photobooth style<p name=\"edd4\" id=\"edd4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">At Edgar, we give employees full access from day one. Credit cards, passwords, the whole kit and caboodle. You don&#8217;t need to &#8220;earn my trust;&#8221; that would be a waste of time. I won&#8217;t hire you <a href=\"http://blog.meetedgar.com/we-need-to-redefine-culture-fit/?&amp;utm_source=Medium%20Article%20-%20Trusting%20Your%20Team&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Guest%20Posts&amp;ajs_event=Clicked%20from%20guest%20post\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unless you already have it</a>.</p><p name=\"5486\" id=\"5486\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;m not saying this always works out perfectly&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I&#8217;ve never had anything like major embezzlement happen, but I have had people who lost my trust. And they don&#8217;t work with me anymore. But that is EXTREMELY rare.</p><p name=\"926c\" id=\"926c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I assume that everyone on my team wants to do their best work and wants the company to <a href=\"http://blog.meetedgar.com/running-from-these-business-realities-heres-how-we-learned-to-embrace-them/?&amp;utm_source=Medium%20Article%20-%20Trusting%20Your%20Team&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Guest%20Posts&amp;ajs_event=Clicked%20from%20guest%20post\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">succeed as much as possible</a>.</p><p name=\"408b\" id=\"408b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Again, why would you keep anyone around who you feel doesn&#8217;t care about the company&#8217;s success??) There are so many lousy companies out there, and so many talented people who do the bare minimum to get by because that&#8217;s what their company has inadvertently encouraged them to do.</p><h4 name=\"bd9b\" id=\"bd9b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Companies encourage &#8220;bad&#8221; behavior in so many&#160;ways.</h4><p name=\"be0d\" id=\"be0d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Micromanaging and redoing work is one of the biggest ones. People learn that their time is wasted anyway because someone else is just going to redo it their own way, so why even try?</p><p name=\"5898\" id=\"5898\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not genuinely taking contributions from the team is another common way to encourage less than the best. Simply saying that you have an &#8220;open door&#8221; policy is nowhere near enough. People need to be asked for their feedback repeatedly, and then they need to see that those ideas are actually being put into action. (Or even better, just let people implement their own ideas without a huge chain of permission.) If that doesn&#8217;t happen, they&#8217;re obviously going to stop offering up their best ideas.</p><p name=\"dd59\" id=\"dd59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Busywork is another performance killer. This includes useless, never-ending meetings, <a href=\"http://blog.meetedgar.com/why-we-stopped-assigning-deadlines-and-started-getting-more-done-because-of-it/?&amp;utm_source=Medium%20Article%20-%20Trusting%20Your%20Team&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Guest%20Posts&amp;ajs_event=Clicked%20from%20guest%20post\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">redundant and excessive documentation</a>; and expecting &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; even if people have nothing to do. They&#8217;re all ways to guarantee that your team will slack off as soon as you step away. No one has any motivation to excel at work that they consider a waste of time.</p><p name=\"c63c\" id=\"c63c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Basically, the way to encourage people to do great work when you&#8217;re not there managing every little step is to <a href=\"http://blog.meetedgar.com/how-we-tackled-the-biggest-problems-in-our-remote-team/?&amp;utm_source=Medium%20Article%20-%20Trusting%20Your%20Team&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=Guest%20Posts&amp;ajs_event=Clicked%20from%20guest%20post\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LET them.</a> Don&#8217;t hire someone who doesn&#8217;t possess massive intrinsic motivation to show up and improve their craft every day.</p><p name=\"197d\" id=\"197d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Hire writers who love to write. Coders who love to code. Customer support staff who get a deep satisfaction from solving people&#8217;s problems.</p><p name=\"7df0\" id=\"7df0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you hire people who love their work and give them the tools they need to do it, trusting your team will never become an issue.</p><p name=\"2a3a\" id=\"2a3a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Laura Roeder is the founder of <a href=\"http://goo.gl/YDiWg5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">content distribution tool MeetEdgar</a>.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p></div>","title":"Why I Trust My Remote Team Completely (And What To Do If You Donâ€™t Trust Yours)"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382e287be056953db7e03"}}
