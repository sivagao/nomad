Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to York</h1><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in York.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">I have lived in York for three years in total, and York is my home town when I am not travelling with&#160;my blog.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What makes York a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">York is a stunning medieval UK city that attracts travelers and tourists from all over the world. The&#160;city of York boasts one of the highest numbers of independent shops within a city centre in the UK.&#160;York was the Roman capital of England, and one of the great things about the city is that it is very&#160;compact and walkable. </p><p class=\"p1\">It is popular for weekend breaks and particularly Christmas shopping&#160;breaks in December. York is also known for the glamour and fashion of York Races.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14099\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/luxury-guide-to-york.jpg?resize=560%2C433&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"433\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What 5 star hotel is the best in York?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>The Royal York Hotel</strong> is my Top 5* hotel in York, although the gym and spa are currently going&#160;under some renovation. The Royal York Hotel has luxury rooms and is situated right by York&#160;railway station. The Grand Hotel in York (formerly Cedar Court) is another top luxury hotel choice. Click <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/The_Royal_York_Hotel.htm\">here</a> for rates and availability.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What about boutique hotels in York, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Located on The Mount, just outside of the city walls near Micklegate, the <strong>Hotel Du Vin</strong> is a stunning&#160;4 star boutique hotel. It has amazing pent-house suites on the top floor and a bistro restaurant. I&#160;would definitely recommend the Hotel Du Vin to friends and family. Click <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Hotel_du_Vin_York.htm\">here</a> for rates and availability.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in York?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Falconry is a popular activity in Yorkshire. You can visit The Bird of Prey Centre which is just 12&#160;miles North of York up the A19. You will probably need a taxi or a car for this trip.&#160;You simply must take a river cruise with &#8216;York Boat&#8217;. There are also evening cruises and lunch timecruises that provide afternoon tea. Head down to the river at Lendall Bridge, or book online with&#160;<a href=\"http://www.yorkboat.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>www.yorkboat.co.uk</strong></a>.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Where are the best hang outs during the day&#160;in York?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Museum Gardens is a beautiful place to relax. They also do free Owl Flying shows on summer&#160;afternoons!&#160;My favourite cafe in York is The Hungry Artist, an art studio and cafe rolled into one. The Hungry&#160;Artist does a beautiful peach tea and offers a menu with many gluten free options.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in York and what are their&#160;best dishes?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">I highly recommend the Blue Bicycle on Fossgate and the Walgate Ale House (you must go there for&#160;a Sunday Roast). If you enjoy Tapas, visit La Ambiente on Goodramgate. All of these restaurants&#160;are walkable from the city centre, because York is a very small and compact medieval city.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14106\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mulled-Wine-Van.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Let&#8217;s talk desserts in York- what place makes the best?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s got to be Betty&#8217;s &#8211; York is famous for this English tea shop with a selection of beautiful desserts&#160;including macaroons. There are some amazing cakes on offer in the Earl Grey Tea Rooms on the&#160;Shambles &#8211; I always go for the Carrot Cake. Also, if you are a chocoholic like me, be sure to head to&#160;the York Chocolate Story cafe!</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us all the hot shopping spots in York; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?</strong>&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\">Explore the independent retailers in the city centre, particularly on the famous street &#8211; The&#160;Shambles. Fossgate also has some quirky shops including &#8216;Give the Dog a Bone&#8217; &#8211; home to many&#160;pop culture gifts and images. For crafty markets, these occur on and around Parliament Street at&#160;different times of the year.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\">If you are looking for designer gear, head to the York Designer Outlet (a 15 minute drive from York&#160;City Centre, near the interchange of the A64 and A19).</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14107\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Roman-Bath.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14103\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Christmas-Market-View.jpg?resize=560%2C262&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"262\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in York?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Middlethorpe Spa on Bishopthorpe Road is the best in the city centre. They do a wonderful&#160;champagne afternoon tea and spa.&#160;If you have a car and are willing to travel outside of York, Aldwark Manor Golf and Spa Hotel is&#160;highly recommended.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14100\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2684455231_b4f3721600_z.jpg?resize=560%2C287&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"287\">credit cathedral:&#160;<a class=\"owner-name truncate\" title=\"Go to r..m's photostream\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/arolandom/\">r..m</a></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us in on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a&#160;great pre-gaming spot.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Fossgate Social on Fossgate itself is a great place to meet for drinks. There are also plenty of&#160;upmarket pubs and bars in York including Harkers, 1331 and Bora Bora. </p><p class=\"p1\">Evil Eye Lounge does&#160;amazing cocktails and has a brilliant atmosphere &#8211; their screaming orgasm is amazing! If you want&#160;a Medieval experience, visit the House of Trembling Madness also on Stonegate.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14101\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/11728820005_e02f09d8d4_z.jpg?resize=560%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\"> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14102\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/11729214324_e821866095_z.jpg?resize=560%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\">credit pub &amp; view:&#160;<a class=\"owner-name truncate\" title=\"Go to Evgenii's photostream\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/94098640@N00/\">Evgenii</a></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>If you end the night at a fancy club in York, which one do you head towards?</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">You can go to Fibbers or the Duchess for dancing until the early hours (they do some good Indie&#160;and Rock nights). However, York is not a big clubbing city &#8211; if you really like good nightlife, head to&#160;Leeds. It&#8217;s only 20-30 minutes away by train. Trains run run after midnight, just check in advance&#160;for your return time.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14105 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/luxury-guide-to-york-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to York\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Hi, I&#8217;m Amy, a social media marketer, teacher and traveller with a lust for life.
