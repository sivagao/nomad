Or at least I&#8217;ve tried to.</p><p name=\"6145\" id=\"6145\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I don&#8217;t call myself digital nomad. And I&#8217;m not a true digital nomad. Whatever a true digital nomad really is. I just wanted to see what it&#8217;s like.</p><p name=\"0fa0\" id=\"0fa0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been to Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.</p><p name=\"66c5\" id=\"66c5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And while trying to visit all of these amazing places I was trying to keep all my other stuff going, as well as some new ideas I wanted to work on for quite some time.</p><p name=\"c483\" id=\"c483\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And what I&#8217;ve learned is that it&#8217;s almost impossible to build anything from scratch while trying to travel and enjoy life at the same time.</p><p name=\"3e3f\" id=\"3e3f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s already super tough to build anything while you&#8217;re at home. In an environment you know. Where you know your obstacles. But trying to build something while traveling is so much harder.</p><p name=\"a4fd\" id=\"a4fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you travel everything is amplified. The distractions. The things to do. The things to see. New people. New places. The barriers. The unknown. The obstacles. Everything. All the time.</p><p name=\"48c7\" id=\"48c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And all of this stuff you&#8217;re reading online on how awesome it is to be a digital nomad is basically a lie. It&#8217;s a lie to sell you a product. Or a lifestyle. Or a service. Or a coaching session. Or whatever.</p><p name=\"9678\" id=\"9678\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">People are trying to sell you the dream. Or the lifestyle package. Or the freedom package. Or the whatever package. For just $99 a month.</p><p name=\"8b95\" id=\"8b95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I ask myself over and over again since when we were able to buy freedom online. Since when we could buy freedom with just a few clicks.</p><p name=\"94f7\" id=\"94f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And even more importantly why should we even pay for freedom? I always thought freedom was a basic human right. And basically for free..</p><p name=\"f5f3\" id=\"f5f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s indeed a strange world we&#8217;re living in.</p><p name=\"fe2c\" id=\"fe2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t get me wrong though. I&#8217;m really, really grateful for this time and all of the incredible things I&#8217;ve learned and experienced. It was an amazing time. It really was.</p><p name=\"e16b\" id=\"e16b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I just want to share the things I&#8217;ve learned over the past few months to paint a more realistic and more honest picture of what it might really look like to be a digital nomad.</p><p name=\"df44\" id=\"df44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># working on the beach</strong></p><p name=\"566e\" id=\"566e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of these pictures you see online where people work on a beach are just BS. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to just check your emails while you&#8217;re in the sun, without an aircon, you&#8217;d know that you&#8217;d die after just a few minutes.</p><p name=\"fe4e\" id=\"fe4e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Working on a beach without an aircon is just not possible. As a matter of fact working anywhere in these dream locations without an aircon is absolutely impossible.</p><p name=\"5fb3\" id=\"5fb3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t believe it? You don&#8217;t have to. Just try to work outside in your home country during summer time for an hour or two. And you&#8217;d instantly understand..</p><p name=\"67ee\" id=\"67ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># work &amp; travel</strong></p><p name=\"1709\" id=\"1709\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Every time you change your location you&#8217;ll lose a few days. Well, it&#8217;s not actually losing time but it&#8217;s time you can&#8217;t use to work. Because you&#8217;ll want to explore the city.</p><p name=\"9810\" id=\"9810\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even if you don&#8217;t want to, you&#8217;d have to figure out a few basic things like where to buy stuff, where to go to eat and so on. After all you don&#8217;t want to eat Mc Donald&#8217;s all the time, right?</p><p name=\"cd76\" id=\"cd76\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Changing location more than every two weeks makes it almost impossible to get a work routine going. It usually took me about two days until I was able to get back into the flow when I moved from one place to another. Sometimes even more, if I didn&#8217;t really like the city. Or ended up in a shitty hostel.</p><p name=\"b8f9\" id=\"b8f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just think about how hard it is to get your work done anywhere else than the office. Sometimes you might be able to work from home.</p><p name=\"b234\" id=\"b234\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But only when you have the perfect setting. It gets soooo much harder to get anything done when just a few things just don&#8217;t feel right..</p><p name=\"38e0\" id=\"38e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># housing</strong></p><p name=\"3faf\" id=\"3faf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finding a good place to stay where you can live and work at the same time will also take a hell lot of time. And searching online just doesn&#8217;t work for most of the places.</p><p name=\"f931\" id=\"f931\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sure, you can go on AirBnB. But they just don&#8217;t have many real flats on it. At leat not at the places I&#8217;ve been to. It&#8217;s usually hostels trying to sell their dorm beds.</p><p name=\"8a27\" id=\"8a27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And even if there were some apartments on AirBnB, the good ones were usually always fully booked.</p><p name=\"68e4\" id=\"68e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And staying in hostels and going to work at a coworking space or local coffee shops is also not a real option. I tried it. More than half of the time I stayed in hostels.</p><p name=\"ff1b\" id=\"ff1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And the sleep you get there just isn&#8217;t real sleep. You&#8217;ll be too tired the next day to get some real work done. Even with earplugs..</p><p name=\"7b7d\" id=\"7b7d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And you don&#8217;t want to buy 5 coffees at Starbucks every single day. Unless you have an unlimited budget. Just like staying in a hotel all the time will get too expensive for most of us.</p><p name=\"b247\" id=\"b247\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># isolation</strong></p><p name=\"5d74\" id=\"5d74\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The only way I was able to get some stuff done was when I completely isolated myself from everything that was going on around me.</p><p name=\"5dc3\" id=\"5dc3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I finally found an apartment I could rent short term or a nice place to stay where I could focus 100% on my work.</p><p name=\"e7f0\" id=\"e7f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Or just like right now.</p><p name=\"718f\" id=\"718f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;ve spent the past two days sitting in the lounge of a hostel where others come to socialize.While everybody was having fun, drinking and going for parties, I was working.</p><p name=\"62d5\" id=\"62d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During these past 3.5 months I went out partying maybe twice.</p><p name=\"a5e0\" id=\"a5e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The thing is this:</p><p name=\"f555\" id=\"f555\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you want to get stuff done, when you want to build (and not just manage) something, you just can&#8217;t do what everybody else is doing.</p><p name=\"7d36\" id=\"7d36\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You have to focus on your own shit. Otherwise you could have stayed at home..</p><p name=\"1fb2\" id=\"1fb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># loneliness</strong></p><p name=\"24d1\" id=\"24d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I call bullshit on everyone who says that being a digital nomad is like living the dream. It&#8217;s one of the hardest things out there.</p><p name=\"50b3\" id=\"50b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And it can be very lonely. I just don&#8217;t think that most people are ready for this. Most people don&#8217;t know how to spend quality time with themselves anymore.</p><p name=\"b5c1\" id=\"b5c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And if there&#8217;s one thing I think that disqualifies almost everyone for being a digital nomad it&#8217;s this.</p><p name=\"ea88\" id=\"ea88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you&#8217;re not able to be alone a lot, then being a digital nomad is definitely not for you.</p><p name=\"366d\" id=\"366d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># routine</strong></p><p name=\"4252\" id=\"4252\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the most important things to get stuff done is to have a routine. And it&#8217;s sooo hard to get a routine up and running when you&#8217;re constantly changing places.</p><p name=\"52a0\" id=\"52a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I found this to be THE most important thing for me to get going. To have something I do EVERY day. What helped me sooo much to keep on going was to write and publish one blog post every day.</p><p name=\"539d\" id=\"539d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No matter how many hours I spent traveling in a bus, no matter what obstacles I encountered during the day, I always pushed myself to do this one thing.</p><p name=\"e2e1\" id=\"e2e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And once I did it, I was usually able to do some more thing. I think if you don&#8217;t have a routine, you won&#8217;t be able to make it work.</p><p name=\"37cc\" id=\"37cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># successful digital nomads</strong></p><p name=\"00e4\" id=\"00e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here&#8217;s the thing.</p><p name=\"2429\" id=\"2429\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The digital nomad hype is filled by people making money selling you the dream. The dream of how amazing it is to be a digital nomad.</p><p name=\"1c51\" id=\"1c51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I think it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s a digital nomad bubble.</p><p name=\"3d22\" id=\"3d22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just show me one successful digital nomad who is making a living without trying to sell you his lifestyle. Or her freedom package. Or whatever online course to change the world. Or whatever tickets to whatever digital nomad conference.</p><p name=\"f47b\" id=\"f47b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The really successful digital nomads, the ones you&#8217;ve probably never heard of, the ones who don&#8217;t brag about being a digital nomad, are usually the ones who just do it and don&#8217;t talk about it. The ones who just do their thing.</p><p name=\"0f93\" id=\"0f93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># freelancing</strong></p><p name=\"7ff8\" id=\"7ff8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The only thing I see how being a digital nomad might work out is to freelance. But this doesn&#8217;t work over night. It needs years and years to make a name for yourself.</p><p name=\"340e\" id=\"340e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can&#8217;t just quit your job and start freelancing from an island tomorrow.</p><p name=\"49a5\" id=\"49a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You need to build your network first. And your portfolio of clients. And this will take a lot more than just buying an online course on how to build a freedom business..</p><p name=\"9be7\" id=\"9be7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"># managing vs. building</strong></p><p name=\"8c5a\" id=\"8c5a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What might also work is to just manage an already well running business. A business you&#8217;ve already built BEFORE you became a digital nomad.</p><p name=\"57bd\" id=\"57bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Starting an online business from scratch, starting anything from scratch while traveling and enjoying life at the same time is just not possible.</p><p name=\"f5d8\" id=\"f5d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unless you&#8217;re trying to sell people your lifestyle (or the digital nomad lifestyle). Then it&#8217;s another story. Because it works. It&#8217;s probably the only thing that really works.</p><p name=\"537f\" id=\"537f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That&#8217;s why most of these so called digital nomads choose that path. And I&#8217;m not blaming them. I do the same. And I&#8217;m a strong believer in doing the things that work.</p><p name=\"d96c\" id=\"d96c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I just feel that it&#8217;s good to know a few things before you buy into the digital nomad hype. Before you become a believer. Before you believe in the digital nomad hype..</p><p name=\"45d1\" id=\"45d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"http://yanngirard.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More about Yann</a> | <a href=\"http://amazon.com/author/yanngirard\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yann&#8217;s Books</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yann.girard.1238\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yann on Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.yanngirard.com/podcast\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yann&#8217;s Podcast</a> |</p></div>","title":"The digital nomad lie – Thought Pills – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937af487be056953db7cf7"}}
