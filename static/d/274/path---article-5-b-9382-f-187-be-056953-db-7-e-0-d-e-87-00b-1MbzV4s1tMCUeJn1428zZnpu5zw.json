But when the cops came, it was over. We had won, we were happy, <a href=\"https://mattrud.com/2016/06/05/czech-cops-dont-like-kiddie-pools/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">we were ready for 11 months of trying to top it</a>.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*XzdWxxLmW0mowUiBI3KQVg.jpeg\"><p name=\"234c\" id=\"234c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The cops left, and our resident DJ Danko refused to stop.</p><p name=\"4f33\" id=\"4f33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was sitting down. I had czeched out&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;like the majority of the group. It&#8217;s over! Stop pushing it.</p><p name=\"0b7f\" id=\"0b7f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then he put on the song. The song without words, the song that was not our type of music, the song that nobody knew except for our then-unfamiliar DJ from Amsterdam.</p><p name=\"79fe\" id=\"79fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One person got up to join the four people lazily dancing. And another. And another. And maybe it was the pilsner, but I felt this magnetism, being pulled by this beat I didn&#8217;t know, and all of a sudden, everyone was jumping their metatarsals off to this song they previously hadn&#8217;t given any shits about.</p><p name=\"889d\" id=\"889d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That feeling of being magnetically sucked into dancing against my will&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;but never regretting it&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;was exactly what I learned from a year of traveling the world, while working remotely, with 70 strangers.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p></div>","title":"I Finished Remote Year: What The Hell Do I Do Now? – Go Remote – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382f187be056953db7e0d"}}
