Generally, I knew ThinkPads to be bulky and heavy, and with the amount of time I spent carrying my laptop (or all my things) on my back, compact and light ultrabooks were more appealing to me. Unfortunately, compact and light ultrabooks come with their own set of problems, including sub-par hardware and specs. When those issues started getting in the way of my work, I was very happy to explore Lenovo&#8217;s best-of-both-worlds offering, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BWnhvg\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">X1 Carbon</a>.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*P-KE0PyXKL5gAaTa.\"><p name=\"056e\" id=\"056e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This light and sleek beauty weighs just a touch over 1.13kg (depending on spec upgrades) and measures 323.5 x 217.1 x 15.95 mm. It&#8217;s a powerhouse in terms of what I need for developer work, with easily a day&#8217;s worth of battery life to boot. When I&#8217;m using it on a plane or haven&#8217;t brought my Roost Stand and external keyboard along, the Carbon&#8217;s built-in classic ThinkPad keyboard is still a pleasure to use. Add to that the little trackpoint that keeps my hands on the home row&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;thereby reducing repetitive stress injury&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and I&#8217;ve found my perfect ultrabook.</p><p name=\"a277\" id=\"a277\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BWnhvg\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo X1 Carbon (5th Gen)</a></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ftTyFzkujI8QhWMH.\"><p name=\"644f\" id=\"644f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It&#8217;s become a regular occurrence when I&#8217;m out working at a busy cafe that several people will stop and ask me, &#8220;What laptop stand is that?&#8221; Seriously, good people of Roost, I have two words for you: ambassador program.</p><p name=\"2568\" id=\"2568\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All joking aside, this is a staple item if you&#8217;re going to work with your laptop while traveling. Having a proper ergonomic set up is essential to preserving the health of your neck and back, and the adjustable stand will morph to suit any table situation from food court tables to cafe bar counters.</p><p name=\"2476\" id=\"2476\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;ve opened, used, and packed this thing nearly every day for a year now, and it&#8217;s still as good as new. Totally worth the investment.</p><p name=\"e024\" id=\"e024\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nR5wu3\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Roost Stand</a></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*LrtuYcwBmIbdAQWn.\"><p name=\"8c6f\" id=\"8c6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This was one of the first items I invested in, along with the Roost Stand. Having a dedicated external keyboard is ergonomically really nice, and having one with which you don&#8217;t need to use an external mouse is even better. The famous little trackpoint nipple in the middle of this keyboard is perfectly placed for use without moving your hands off the home row, and saves your wrists from repetitive stress injury.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*_3s5V96hQKtK8HAl.\"><p name=\"9edc\" id=\"9edc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">There are two little fold-out feet on the bottom of the keyboard that make it even more ergonomically friendly. This hardy little piece of tech has been squashed in my bag and toted around to cafes around the world all year. It needs charging about once every six months (yeah that&#8217;s not a typo). It&#8217;s never let me down.</p><p name=\"a720\" id=\"a720\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iRdGgH\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with trackpoint</a></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*-NgmIiEtJnD8MG3F.\"><p name=\"8ae0\" id=\"8ae0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I love this little thing! I&#8217;m one of those one-baggers who&#8217;s a little too concerned with whether or not I could shave off another 500g or so&#8230; this cute little battery-powered pack companion helps me keep track of my loadout weight. It&#8217;s simple to use and hardly weighs a thing itself, at just about 125g.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*XVII5okYh3jIYWJm.\"><p name=\"fee2\" id=\"fee2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I love the dedicated on/off switch that keeps it from accidentally running out the batteries when stuffed in my pack. My favorite part though is the fact that I don&#8217;t need a screwdriver to change the batteries, unlike many luggage scales you&#8217;ll find sold in airports. I mean, who travels with a tiny screwdriver? It&#8217;s not even a standard size. I always thought the real ploy there was to get you to just throw out the whole scale and buy another when the batteries drained. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BrSlSO\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Travelon&#8217;s Micro Scale</a> fixes all that, in a super-handy, compact package.</p><p name=\"e3ed\" id=\"e3ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BrSlSO\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Travelon&#8217;s Micro Scale</a></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*2QYhLdHDVf-AJD1M.\"><p name=\"dfe7\" id=\"dfe7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I got these mostly to win one battle in my own personal war on using disposable plastics, especially in countries where garbage handling and recycling facilities just aren&#8217;t yet up to snuff. At just a measly 22g, this fork and spoon duo is just as sturdy as classic cutlery, and far more sturdy than disposable plastic cutlery. They nest for compact storage, and join together to create a longer utensil. After I use them, I just give them a quick rinse or wipe, then nest and stow&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;you can give them a better wash later on. They&#8217;re well worth the few bucks they cost.</p><p name=\"d00e\" id=\"d00e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BYd15Q\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Humangear GoBites Duo, Gray</a></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*2wW1QqA8ytEHyNwE.\"><p name=\"0100\" id=\"0100\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you remember from <a href=\"https://heronebag.com/blog/6-minaal-carry-on/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my original Minaal review</a>, one of the few things I didn&#8217;t like about the original 2.0 was the grey color, which sometimes looked green under indoor lights, despite the fact that it consistently photographed well. After receiving the black one, I wrote a short <a href=\"https://heronebag.com/blog/minaal-colors/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">color comparison</a> post with more photos. In short, I like the new color a lot better, despite the fact that the black fabric is a fuzz magnet.</p><p name=\"7cfd\" id=\"7cfd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Other than the color, as my original review post will attest, I love the bag as much as I did when I first wrote about it. It&#8217;s held up beautifully over the course of my first few months of pretty constant travel with it.</p><p name=\"eaa3\" id=\"eaa3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Minaal&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.minaal.com/collections/your-future-gear-black/products/packing-cubes\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">packing cubes</a> are a recent addition, and are, to my pleasant surprise, quite useful. I originally thought there was no difference between these or using any other packing cubes, but the fact that these are sized especially to fit into the Carry-on&#8217;s available space really does make a difference in terms of taking advantage of that space. I&#8217;m able to fit all of my clothing into the large packing cube, which compresses it slightly when zipped up. When the bag is fully packed, there&#8217;s absolutely no wasted space around the cubes. Everything in the photo at the top of this post fits inside the Minaal Carry-on&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;with just enough space left over for a half-dozen protein bars or so.</p><p name=\"ee01\" id=\"ee01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"https://www.minaal.com/collections/your-future-gear-black/products/minaal-carry-on-bag-aoraki-black\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Minaal Carry-on 2.0 in Aoraki black</a></p></div>","title":"Digital Nomad Gear Essentials 2018 [Updated!] â€“ Future Travel"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937b1087be056953db7d12"}}
