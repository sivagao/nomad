But for some people, that&#8217;s easier said than done. Choosing from the many options on display can be a little a lotta overwhelming, especially if it&#8217;s your first visit. We&#8217;ve been there, done that, and it&#8217;s not fun when your stomach is growling in hunger but your eyes are saying, &#8220;What the heck is that?&#8221;</p>\n<h2><p>Try These Easy-to-Eat Thai Street Snacks</p></h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve put together a list of Thai finger foods that are almost all less than a dollar (even for several pieces) and can be nibbled on while you&#8217;re walking around. In other words, you don&#8217;t need to be sitting down with a set of silverware to enjoy these tasty treats and it won&#8217;t hurt the bank.</p>\n<p>Our list includes details such as both the English and Thai name (with proper pronunciation, tones and all), a short description of what it looks like, as well as a summary of how it tastes to help you get a better idea of what you&#8217;re in for. In no particular order, here are snacks that you can find from many street hawkers in Thailand.</p>\n<h2><p>Roti Gluay | Banana Cr&#234;pe</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19338\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Roti-Gluay-Thai-Banana-Crepe-iStock-845999100-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Banana Roti Thai Street Food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/Nadezhda Zaitceva</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>roh-dtee gl&#244;o-ai | &#3650;&#3619;&#3605;&#3637;&#3585;&#3621;&#3657;&#3623;&#3618;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Look for a cart that has bananas, eggs, and cans of Carnation sweetened condensed milk on display. You&#8217;ll see the vendor slapping out a thin disk of dough and cooking something on a griddle that looks like a cr&#234;pe.</p>\n<h3>What Banana Roti Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Roti is a sweet treat that&#8217;s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A classic combo is banana and egg filling, which tastes similar to banana custard. You can also put Nutella, peanut butter, mango, corn, and even cheese inside. When finished cooking, drizzle sweetened condensed milk, chocolate, or honey on top.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>The roti will be cut up into bite-sized pieces and served on a little tray or plate. Grab a thin bamboo skewer to stab each piece.</p>\n<h2><p>Moo Bing Kao Nieow | Grilled Pork &amp; Sticky Rice</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19312\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pork-Skewers-Moo-Bing.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pork Skewers - Moo Bing | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>m&#466;o bp&#238;ng c&#244;w nee-&#466;w | &#3627;&#3617;&#3641;&#3611;&#3636;&#3657;&#3591;&#3586;&#3657;&#3634;&#3623;&#3648;&#3627;&#3609;&#3637;&#3618;&#3623;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>These carts will be paired with a small grill, so you can smell the smoky goodness of moo bping from a little way down the road. Look for short skewers of bite-sized meat that&#8217;s usually orangy red with charred edges.</p>\n<h3>What Moo Bing Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Moo bing is usually made from a fatty cut of pork, so it&#8217;s tender and extremely flavorful (think bacon). It&#8217;s also got a sweet and salty flavor thanks to a marinated made of oyster sauce, soy sauce, and palm sugar, among other things. The grill gives it an unmistakable smokiness.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Buy 3 or 4 pieces and eat it directly off the skewer in between small bites of sticky rice, which can be bought separately for around 5 baht per bag.</p>\n<h2><p>Ideam Khanom Bung | Thai Ice Cream Sandwich</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19326\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ideam-Khanom-Bung-Thai-Ice-Cream-Sandwich-iStock-878204774-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai Ice Cream Sandwich - Ideam Khanom Bung | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/phattaraphum</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>i-dtim k&#224;-n&#466;hm bung | &#3652;&#3629;&#3605;&#3636;&#3617;&#3586;&#3609;&#3617;&#3611;&#3633;&#3591;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a literal ice cream sandwich! Look for a scoop or two of ice cream (coconut, mixed fruit, or Thai tea flavors) that&#8217;s been pressed into a bun or between two pieces of white bread. Some popular toppings include coconut cream, toasted peanuts, and shavings of fresh coconut.</p>\n<h3>What a Thai Ice Cream Sandwich Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>This unassuming sandwich is a frozen, squishy treat that&#8217;s perfect while walking around in the hot afternoon. Simple yet fun, it really shows an east-meets-west snack style. It&#8217;s also great that the bread helps to prevent any ice cream drips.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Pick your ice cream flavor, your toppings, and then eat it like a sandwich or a hotdog.</p>\n<h2><p>Nam Ponlamai Bun | Fruit Smoothie</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19309\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fruit-Smoothie-Nam-Ponlamai-Bun.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fruit Smoothie - Nam Ponlamai Bun | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>n&#225;hm p&#242;hn-l&#224;-m&#225;i b&#249;n | &#3609;&#3657;&#3635;&#3612;&#3621;&#3652;&#3617;&#3657;&#3611;&#3633;&#3656;&#3609;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Street stalls that have access to electrical outlets will power up their blenders and make all sorts of combinations of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs.</p>\n<h3>What It Tastes like</h3>\n<p>Tropical freshness. A good smoothie vendor will toss in ample amounts of fruit and vegetable and put just enough ice and water it to get it cold and give it the right consistency. Don&#8217;t be afraid to try some unusual combinations such as mango and avocado or pineapple, orange, and watermelon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p> Don&#8217;t buy a fruit smoothie from a vendor that has syrups on display. Stick with vendors who use fresh fruit.\n\n\n\n<h2><p>Khao Nieow Mamuang | Mango Sticky Rice</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19349\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Khao-Nieow-Mamuang-Thai-Mango-Sticky-Rice-iStock-614622430-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mango Sticky Rice - Khao Nieow Mamuang | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/ampols</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>c&#244;w nee-&#466;w m&#225;-m&#244;o-ahng | &#3586;&#3657;&#3634;&#3623;&#3648;&#3627;&#3609;&#3637;&#3618;&#3623;&#3617;&#3632;&#3617;&#3656;&#3623;&#3591;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Look for a scoop of creamy white rice topped with yellow-orange mango slices. Variations include a drizzle of coconut cream or a sprinkling of puffed rice on top.</p>\n<h3>What Mango Sticky Rice Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Chances are you&#8217;ll get a perfectly ripe mango, so you&#8217;re in for a sweet treat. The glutinous rice is mixed with coconut milk and a bit of sugar and salt. After being cooked, it&#8217;s a dessert-like creamy coconut sticky rice.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>With a spoon because you&#8217;ll probably want seconds.</p>\n<h2><p>Miang Kham | Leaf-Wrapped Bites</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19335\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Miang-Kham-Thai-Betel-Leaf-Wrapped-Snack-iStock-478864048-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Betel Leaf Wrap - Miang Kham | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/JaruekChairak</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>m&#234;e-ahng kahm | &#3648;&#3617;&#3637;&#3656;&#3618;&#3591;&#3588;&#3635;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>While browsing through street stalls, look for dark green leaf bundles about the size of golf balls. Sometimes they&#8217;ll be on bamboo skewers while other times they&#8217;ll be laid out individually. The wild pepper leaves are filled with diced tidbits (raw ginger, raw garlic, sliced chilies, nutty peanuts, toasted coconut shreds, lemongrass, teensy lime wedges, raw shallots) and served with a shrimp-based sweet and sour sauce.</p>\n<h3>What Miang Kham Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>This one-bite snack packs powerful flavors. Sweet, salty, pungent, sour, and spicy, it&#8217;s an excellent representation of Thai flavor combos. A little goes a long way but it&#8217;s a fun, very unique, and easy-to-eat Thai snack.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Skewers usually come with three of four bundles on the. Buy one or two skewers and dip the bundles directly in the sauce. Don&#8217;t unwrap them. Eat everything, leaves and all.</p>\n<h2><p>Pa Tong Go | Thai-Chinese Fried Pastry</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19336\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pa-Tong-Go-Thai-Chinese-Fried-Pastry-iStock-473287108-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai-Chinese Fried Pastry - Pa Tong Go | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/thawornnurak</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce it</h3>\n<p>bpa-t&#226;wng-g&#466;h | &#3611;&#3634;&#3607;&#3656;&#3629;&#3591;&#3650;&#3585;&#3659;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>A wide, shallow vat frying up pairs of dough sticks shaped like chromosomes (or sometimes dough disks) that are about 2-3 inches long. When finished frying, they&#8217;re a golden brown color.</p>\n<h3>What Thai-Chinese Fried Pastry Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>The fried dough is a mix between a donut and bread. They are crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on their honeycombed inside. By themselves, they are rather plain, so it&#8217;s not uncommon to eat them with custard or soy milk.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat Them</h3>\n<p>Buy 5 to 10 pieces and dip them in white custard (sungk&#224;y&#259;h, &#3626;&#3633;&#3591;&#3586;&#3618;&#3634;) or green pandan-flavored custard (sungk&#224;y&#259;h bai dtuey, &#3626;&#3633;&#3591;&#3586;&#3618;&#3634;&#3651;&#3610;&#3648;&#3605;&#3618;) that&#8217;s made of coconut milk and egg. Or between bites enjoy sips of hot soy milk (n&#225;hm dt&#244;w h&#244;o, &#3609;&#3635;&#3657;&#3648;&#3605;&#3657;&#3634;&#3627;&#3641;&#3657;) that&#8217;s lightly sweetened and flavored with ginger.</p>\n<h2><p>Satay | Satay</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19342\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Thai-Satay-iStock-678651074-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Satay | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/wattanachon</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>s&#249;h-dt&#224;y | &#3626;&#3632;&#3648;&#3605;&#3658;&#3632;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Look for vendors grilling skewers of yellowish chicken (g&#224;i, &#3652;&#3585;&#3656;) or pork (m&#466;o, &#3627;&#3617;&#3641;). This snack is served with two dipping sauces.</p>\n<h3>What Satay Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>The meat is lightly flavored with a plethora of Thai spices and gets its characteristic yellow color from turmeric. What really gives the uumph to this Thai street snack is the sauces. One is a chunky peanut sauce flavored with garlic, soy sauce, and tamarind paste. The other is a clear sweet and sour dipping sauce with tiny bits of green cucumbers, red chilies, and purple shallots.</p>\n<h2><p>Khanom Krok | Thai Coconut Pancakes</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19329\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Khanom-Khrok-Thai-Coconut-Pancakes-iStock-890372760-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai Coconut Pancakes - Khanom Khrok | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/ArnonPolin</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>k&#224;-n&#466;hm kr&#242;hk | &#3586;&#3609;&#3617;&#3588;&#3619;&#3585;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>The name &#8216;pancakes&#8217; is a little misleading. We like to think of them more like warm, spongy pillows of heavenly deliciousness. They are cooked in a special cast iron skillet that makes half spheres. When the outsides are crispy (but the insides are a bit gooey still), the vendor will take them out and place two halves together creating a sphere. Typically 4-5 pieces per package are served.</p>\n<h3>What Khanom Krok Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a dessert made from coconut milk and rice flour, so it&#8217;s sweet and creamy but has a little more structure to it than coconut pudding. They can be served plain or the halves are sprinkled with minced spring onions, shredded carrot, or diced sweet potato or pumpkin while it&#8217;s cooking.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>You can expect to get 3 to 5 pieces when you order a set of khanom krok. Use&#160;your fingers or grab a small bamboo skewer to spear it. Get ones that are fresh off the skillet, but just be sure to wait until they cool off so you don&#8217;t burn your mouth.</p>\n<h2><p>Salapao | Chinese Steamed Bun</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19339\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Salapao-Thai-Chinese-Steamed-Bun-iStock-897263068-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai-Chinese Steamed Bun - Salapao | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/Terry Wratten</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>sah-lah-bpow | &#3595;&#3634;&#3621;&#3634;&#3648;&#3611;&#3634;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>A white, puffy bun that is usually in a glass display case or in a tall metal steamer. The different flavors are distinguishable by the colored dots (or lack thereof) on the tops or bottoms of the buns.</p>\n<h3>What Chinese Steamed Buns Taste Like</h3>\n<p>Salapaos can be either sweet or savory and should be served hot. Sweet fillings include mashed sweet bean filling or custard while savory fillings are often minced meat with herbs or saucy grilled meat. The bun is divine. Fluffy yet slightly chewy, it offers a little sweetness that complements the fillings.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Buy one or two and eat it like a donut. Just make sure to peel off the thin piece of paper on the bottom or eat around it.</p>\n<h2><p>Khao Lahm | Bamboo Sticky Rice</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19330\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Khao-Lahm-Thai-Bamboo-Sticky-Rice-iStock-614850870-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai Bamboo Sticky Rice - Khao Lahm | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/urf</p>\n<h3>How to Really Produce It</h3>\n<p>c&#244;w l&#259;hm | &#3586;&#3657;&#3634;&#3623;&#3627;&#3621;&#3634;&#3617;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Tubes of tan or green bamboo roughly 1 inch in diameter and about 10 inches long. They may or may not be cooking on a grill.</p>\n<h3>What Bamboo Sticky Rice Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Only eat what&#8217;s inside the bamboo. You&#8217;ll find sticky rice that is slightly sweet and creamy thanks to coconut milk and it&#8217;s dotted with tender black beans.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>This is a fun snack to eat. Pull out the banana leaf &#8216;plug&#8217; from the top of the bamboo tube and then peel back the grilled bamboo like a banana, revealing the molded rice inside. Rip of bite-sized pieces as you work your way down to the bottom of the bamboo tube.</p>\n<p><b>Related Read: <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/chiang-mai-gate-food-stalls/\">Cheap Eats at Chiang Mai Gate Food</a></b></p>\n<h2><p>Sungkaya Fuktong | Thai Pumpkin Custard</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19340\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sungkaya-Fuktong-Thai-Pumpkin-Custard-iStock-901796308-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pumpkin Custard - Sungkaya Fuktong | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/Kwhisky</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>s&#249;ngk&#224;y&#259;h f&#250;hk-tawng | &#3626;&#3633;&#3591;&#3586;&#3618;&#3634;&#3615;&#3633;&#3585;&#3607;&#3629;&#3591;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>This dessert is usually made with small Thai pumpkins that are about the size of a flattened soccer ball football and are dark green on the outside and a yellow-orange in the inside. It is cut into a wedge and the hollowed part is filled with a cream-colored egg custard.</p>\n<h3>What Thai Pumpkin Custard Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Thai pumpkin is milder in flavor than your bright orange Northern American pumpkin but still tastes distinctly pumpkin. The gourd is steamed so the flesh is very soft. This dessert is complemented well by the rich and creamy coconut custard.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Eat the pumpkin flesh and custard and discard the pumpkin skin.</p>\n<h2><p>Sai Grok Isaan | Isaan Sour Sausage</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19351\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sai-Grok-Isaan-Isaan-Sour-Sausage.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Isaan Sour Sausage - Sai Grok Isaan | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"></p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>s&#238;gh gr&#224;wk ee-s&#259;hn | &#3652;&#3626;&#3657;&#3585;&#3619;&#3629;&#3585;&#3629;&#3637;&#3626;&#3634;&#3609;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Sour sausage is pinkish in color and can be found on skewers or in long chains of 1 centimeter balls. The vendor always has a grill going to cook up these tasty morsels.</p>\n<h3>What Isaan Sour Sausage Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s tangy, smoky, and garlicky and has a buttery, slightly chewy texture. A little bit goes a long way, so many times the vendors mix rice or clear noodles into the casing to serve it.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>One skewer is usually enough. Otherwise, buy 5 to 10 mini balls and grab a small bamboo skewer. In between bites of sai grok Isaan, nibble on the accompanying slices of ginger, chopped raw cabbage, and (if you dare) prik kee noo chilis.</p>\n<h2><p>Mamuang Klook Prik Glua | Green Mango with Salt, Chili, &amp; Sugar</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19334\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mamuang-Klook-Prik-Glua-Thai-Green-Mango-Salt-Chili-Sugar-iStock-466739490-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Green Mango Salt, Chili, Sugar - Mamuang Klook Prik Glua | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/kitchakron</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>m&#225;-m&#244;o-ahng kl&#243;ok pr&#237;k gleua | &#3617;&#3632;&#3617;&#3656;&#3623;&#3591;&#3588;&#3621;&#3640;&#3585;&#3614;&#3619;&#3636;&#3585;&#3648;&#3585;&#3621;&#3639;&#3629;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Vendors with slices of green mango with small plastic bags or containers of a white and red dipping powder. Some might already sprinkle the seasoning on the fruit.</p>\n<h3>What Green Mango with Salt, Chili, &amp; Sugar Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>Green mangos are tart, crunchy, not sweet and kind of suck the spit out of your mouth. The sliced fruit is served with a seasoning made of sugar, salt, and dried chilies, so it has that classic Thai flavor profile: sour, sweet, salty, and spicy. Our favorite is when it&#8217;s made with smoky dried chilies.</p>\n<h3>How to Eat It</h3>\n<p>Grab a slice of fruit and dip it in the seasoning as little or as much as you&#8217;d like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p> If you have the taste for something more adventurous and don&#8217;t mind fish sauce and shrimp paste, try mamuang nampla wan (m&#225;-m&#244;o-ahng n&#225;hm blah w&#259;hn, &#3617;&#3632;&#3617;&#3656;&#3623;&#3591;&#3609;&#3657;&#3635;&#3611;&#3621;&#3634;&#3627;&#3623;&#3634;&#3609;).

The dessert version is perfect for sweet tooths (they&#8217;re a bit too sweet for us) and has toppings like shredded coconut and sweet golden egg yolk threads. Savory toppings include spring onions, pork threads, shrimp, and egg.</p>\n<h2><p>Khao Tom Mud | Banana Leaf Sticky Rice</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Khao-Tom-Mud-Thai-Banana-Leaf-Sticky-Rice-iStock-177697949-.jpg?resize=1000%2C664&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Banana Leaf Sticky Rice - Khao Tom Mud | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\">iStock.com/Xiebiyun</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>c&#244;w dt&#244;hm m&#250;t | &#3586;&#3657;&#3634;&#3623;&#3605;&#3657;&#3617;&#3617;&#3633;&#3604;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Cylindrical packets of grilled or steamed banana leaves that are a few inches long.

Some are tourist-friendly while others are off-putting to untrained tastebuds (such as ones filled with fermented meat!!) One way to avoid getting a pungent surprise is to ask the vendor, &#8220;w&#259;hn m&#259;i&#8221; which means, &#8220;Is it sweet?&#8221; If the vendor replies, &#8220;w&#259;hn,&#8221; then it&#8217;s sweet. If the vendor says, &#8220;m&#226;i w&#259;hn,&#8221; that means &#8220;not sweet&#8221;, so it&#8217;s definitely not banana and sticky rice inside!\n\n\n\n<h2><p>Gluay Khaek | Thai Fried Bananas</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"no_pin aligncenter wp-image-19325 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Gluay-Khaek-Thai-Fried-Bananas-iStock-826186838-.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fried Bananas - Gluay Khaek | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\">iStock.com/Charlie Waradee</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>gl&#244;o-ai k&#224;ek | &#3585;&#3621;&#3657;&#3623;&#3618;&#3649;&#3586;&#3585;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Vendors make this popular snack by slicing bananas long-ways, battering them, and then deep-frying them to a dark golden brown.</p>\n<h3>What Thai Fried Bananas Taste Like</h3>\n<p>Thai fried bananas don&#8217;t taste like any ol&#8217; fried bananas. The batter is usually made of coconut flour and rice flour. Sometimes wheat flour is used and sesame seeds are added, too. They are naturally sweet, super crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. There aren&#8217;t any toppings or drizzled syrup on the fried bananas, so eat them right out of the bag or from your plate.</p>\n<h2><p>Ba Be Kiew | Thai BBQ Skewers</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19324\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ba-Be-Kiew-Thai-BBQ-Skewers-iStock-650117736-.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"BBQ Skewers - Ba Be Kiew | Food Guide to Thai Street Snacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\">iStock.com/coffeekai</p>\n<h3>How to Really Pronounce It</h3>\n<p>bah bee kee-ew | &#3610;&#3634;&#3619;&#3660;&#3610;&#3637;&#3588;&#3636;&#3623;</p>\n<h3>What to Look For</h3>\n<p>Look for colorful kabobs that include bite-sized pieces of marinated pork, chicken, or beef paired with a tiny tomato, and slices of onion, green bell pepper, and pineapple.</p>\n<h3>What Thai BBQ Tastes Like</h3>\n<p>These barbecue skewers are lightly marinated and then glazed with tangy tomato sauce (dare we say ketchup?) and generous amounts of ground pepper while they&#8217;re on the grill.
