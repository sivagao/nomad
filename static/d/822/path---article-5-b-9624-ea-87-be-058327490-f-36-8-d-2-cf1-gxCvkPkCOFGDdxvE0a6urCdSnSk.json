I recalculated it a number of times to make sure I wasn&#8217;t adding an extra couple of years but that&#8217;s right, 10 years ago on this date I wrote the first foXnoMad post.</p>\n<p><strong>A Short History Tale</strong></p>\n<p>Back then in 2006, this was a blog I created for a few friends and myself, so we could keep in touch. After a few weeks, I was the only one actually posting &#8211; a process that was surprisingly enjoyable. There&#8217;s a lot of crap from those early posts and it would have probably continued that way, until someone other than my mother left a comment. After a complete stranger had found foXnoMad (it wasn&#8217;t even named that yet) it occurred to me maybe I should put some effort into what I wrote on the Internet.</p>\n<p>So I focused on two things I knew and was passionate about: <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/category/travel/\">travel</a> and <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/category/travel/tech/\">technology</a>. Some time later <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/about/press/\">foXnoMad took off</a> with me following, on a journey that is now a <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/about/\">quest to visit every country in the world</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Catching Up With Time</strong></p>\n<p>I move around. A lot. Constant motion means I&#8217;m continually <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2011/06/21/common-misconceptions-and-several-truths-about-travel-blogging-digital-nomads/\">balancing writing with traveling</a>. Over the years, I had been keeping pace but didn&#8217;t have much opportunity to eliminate a pesky to-do list, plus turn some other ideas into reality. Not so much now, over the past 6 months I&#8217;ve been (more or less) in one place and in front of a laptop longer than I&#8217;ve been in years.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see the results of this temporary slowdown soon throughout the rest of 2016, <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/upcoming-stops/\">most likely while I&#8217;m exploring</a> some jungle I shouldn&#8217;t be in or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BGbe8nshqOC/\">testing any rational person&#8217;s fear of heights</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>A Big Thank You</strong></p>\n<p>All of this &#8211; my dream to travel the world and write about the places I visit is because you read and support this blog. (Plus the blogger behind it.) I look forward to continuing the trip with you as foXnoMad expands later this year beyond anything I could have imagined in 2006.</p>\n<p>Travel smarter,<br>\n-Anil</p>\n<p>[Photo by: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6331610\">GDallimore</a>]</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"I Started This Blog 10 Years Ago Today"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9624ea87be058327490f36"}}
