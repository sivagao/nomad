Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to Santa Marta</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about&#160; yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in&#160;Santa Marta.</i></b></p><p>I&#8217;m Gemma from Two Scots Abroad. 5&#8221;2 &#189;, Scottish with a love for all things vintage and thrift store so luxury isn&#8217;t always my bag but we struck it lucky last year in Santa Marta, Colombia! I&#8217;m travelling with my fianc&#233;, Craig; we&#8217;re on an 18 month career break to travel the Americas and Europe.<b><i> </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes S<b><i>anta Marta</i></b></i></b><b><i>&#160;a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Santa Marta is sunny! It&#8217;s typically where Colombians go on holiday and other backpackers suggested we skipped it but I&#8217;m glad we went with gut instinct and spent some time there because it is the gateway to paradise!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13110\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/La-Calzada-del-Santo-Pool.jpg?resize=560%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What is the best boutique hotel in&#160;<b><i>S<b><i>anta Marta</i></b></i></b>?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/La_Calzada_del_Santo.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>La Calzada del Santo</strong></a> is just lovely. We stayed on the top floor of the boutique hotel, our room door practically opened onto the rooftop pool. There were hammocks to relax on whilst taking in the views of the city. The owner, Rita, is just a doll, she treats everyone with warmth and her staff are extremely friendly. The hotel is very modern, exposed red brick in the hotel room, TV, speedy Wi-Fi. Breakfast of colourful fruit and eggs is served every morning.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13107\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Costeno-Beach.jpg?resize=560%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13104\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Casa-Loma-Minca-Sunset.jpg?resize=560%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler&#160;<b><i>in&#160;<b><i>S<b><i>anta Marta?</i></b></i></b></i></b></i></b></p><p>Santa Marta can be used a springboard to the beaches of Colombia. Within an hour by bus, you can reach Coste&#241;o Beach for those who like to surf and do yoga or just swing on a hammock on the beach. A short journey after Coste&#241;o is Palomino where you can tube down the river. Most notably and not to be missed is a trip to Tayrona National Park.</p><p><strong>Where would you go for a nice afternoon hike?</strong></p><p></p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13105\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Casa-Loma-Viewing-Platform-Minca.jpg?resize=560%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"><p>It&#8217;s tough to beat Tayrona National Park, take the minibus to the entrance as it&#8217;s about a tour hour walk from there. The walk is along the coastal beaches and through the palm trees laden with coconuts &#8211; watch out for the cheeky monkeys in the trees!</p><p></p><p><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day in<b><i>&#160;<b><i>S<b><i>anta Marta?</i></b></i></b></i></b></i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Santa Marta has a beach and a marina with some bars.

This cute cobbled lane is decorated with lanterns. There are a few restaurants and bars to choose from which serve intentional and local cuisine<b>. </b>And cocktails obviously!</p><p><strong>&#8230;and the best breakfast in Santa Marta?</strong></p><p>Panaderia in Tayrona National Park serves dense white bread with melteted chocolate inside, it also has a caramel version and a savoury type, the are honestly the size of your head!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts&#160;<b><i>in&#160;<b><i>S<b><i>anta Marta</i></b></i></b></i></b>&#8211; what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p>Pop in for some Froyo at Carambolo.<b><i> </i></b></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13109\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/La-Calzada-del-Santo-Hammoack-Two-Scots.jpg?resize=560%2C349&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"349\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13108\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gemma-and-Craig-Two-Scots-Abroad-Pinterest2c-Salar-de-Uyuni2c-Bolivia.jpg?resize=560%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Santa Marta\" width=\"560\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view <b><i>in&#160;<b><i>S<b><i>anta Marta</i></b></i></b></i></b>&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p>The best sunset we saw in this area was at Minca in the Sierra Nevada Mountains &#8211; again another short bus ride from Santa Marta.
