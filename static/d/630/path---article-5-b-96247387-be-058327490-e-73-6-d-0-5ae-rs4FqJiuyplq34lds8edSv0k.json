The PwP raises money $10 at a time &#8211; for each $10 donation you make, you can enter yourself for one of these <a href=\"http://www.passportswithpurpose.org/donate/\">wonderfully donated prizes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Working With Room To Read</strong></p>\n<p>This year PwP is working with <a href=\"http://www.roomtoread.org/\">Room To Read</a>, an organization that has built over 12,500 libraries and worked with over 6 million children since its founding in 1998. Neuroscientists regularly refer to reading as the most complex task our brains ever learn, getting parts of the brain to work in ways no other method can.

You can <a href=\"http://www.passportswithpurpose.org/donate/\">donate here</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year I&#8217;m offering up a <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-tablet-barnes-noble/1104687969\">Nook Tablet</a>, one of my favorite new gadgets on the market. And yes, they don&#8217;t ship outside of the US so I&#8217;ll mail you one wherever you are in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Why The Nook Tablet?</strong></p>\n<p>Aside from the ironic fact that it&#8217;s an eReader, it&#8217;s also the most versatile 7-inch tablet designed for ebooks. The Nook Tablet is a personal favorite of mine; and an eReader can lighten your backpack by letting you carry around a 400 gram library on your shoulder. Plus it&#8217;s wife-capable, letting you browse the Internet, and plays games as well. (Angry Birds on a long layover anyone?)</p>\n<p><strong>Details, Deadlines, And Donate!</strong></p>\n<p>Remember, for every $10 donation you get one chance to win any of <a href=\"http://www.passportswithpurpose.org/donate/\">these prizes</a> of your choosing. They include 9-day tours to Costa Rica, a 1-year Boingo Global Account, and even a Kindle Fire if that&#8217;s more your fancy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Donations can be made anytime but if you to enter for a prize your deadline is December 16, 2011.</li>\n<li>Prize winners will be notified on Friday, December 23rd and prize delivered within 7 business days if you&#8217;re in the US. Those of you in other countries will receive your prize within 17 business days (the added time since I&#8217;ll need someone to forward it to your address).</li>\n<li>Prize is void if we don&#8217;t communicate by January 31, 2012.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2009 PwP raised $30,000 to build a school in Cambodia and last year $64,000 to help build a village in India.
