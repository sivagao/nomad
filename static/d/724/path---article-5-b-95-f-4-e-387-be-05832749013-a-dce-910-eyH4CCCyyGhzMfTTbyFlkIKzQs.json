Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what you may get in exchange for working in Thailand&#8217;s school system.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2><p id=\"Is_Teaching_in_Thailand_Worth_it\"><p>Is Teaching in Thailand Worth it?</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"The Students That Keep Me Busy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Dusit-7.jpg?resize=563%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Is teaching in Thailand worth it?\" width=\"563\" height=\"405\"></p>\n<p>This is one of those questions that will always be answered many different ways. After living and teaching in Thailand for the better part of &#160;a year and experiencing the cost of living in Chiang Mai, here&#8217;s what I have to say.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"A_Teacher8217s_Salary_in_Chiang_Mai\"><p>A Teacher&#8217;s Salary in Chiang Mai</p></p></h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m a teacher at a private school in Chiang Mai and earn a monthly salary of 28,000 baht. Now, you may ask, &#8220;Is teaching in Thailand worth it for $900 a month?&#8221; If you&#8217;e flying solo, you can live a decent life in Chiang Mai on that kind of money.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7719\" title=\"Enjoying a Brief Moment Off of My Feet\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Dusit-5.jpg?resize=563%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Is teaching in Thailand Worth it?\" width=\"563\" height=\"444\"></p>\n<p>There are modest single bedroom apartments for 6,000-8,000 baht ($200 to $260 USD) per month, which leaves you with up to $700 in spending money. With those funds, you can eat out most nights alternating between Thai and western cuisine, enjoy drinks on weekends, shop a bit, rent a motorbike, fill up on gas, and pay your monthly electric bill. With a little planning, you can even make small weekend trips. There won&#8217;t be much left over, but you shouldn&#8217;t be pinching pennies during the months there are classes.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-7701 \" title=\"Affordable Trip to Pai, Thailand on a Teachers Salary\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pai-Thailand-43.jpg?resize=563%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Is teaching in Thailand worth it with places like Pai?\" width=\"563\" height=\"393\"><p>My salary includes paid time off during Thai holidays, which average to about four days each semester. If I happen to be sick or need to take off, my pay is deducted by the cost of the substitute teacher. In my experience, substitute teachers are paid a higher hourly rate than I am, so it actually costs me money to take a day off.</p>\n<p>My school provides free lunch for teachers. I eat lunch at school almost every day, which at about 50 baht a meal (the cost of food and drink) saves me 1100 baht or $35 a month.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Getting_a_Thai_Non-Immigrant_Business_Visa\"><p>Getting a Thai Non-Immigrant Business Visa</p></p></h2>\n<p>In addition to getting paid for teaching, I get a business visa, which I think is extremely valuable. Having a business visa allows you to stay in Thailand for the length of your school contract up to 12 months (three months for a single entry business visa plus the nine-ish month extension) without making border runs.</p>\n<p>I paid for my own single entry business visa (2000 baht), the one year extension (1900 baht), and the transportation and accommodation costs during my <a title=\"Chiang Mai to Vientiane Visa Run\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/visa-run-chiang-mai-to-vientiane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visa run</a>. I didn&#8217;t pay for the work permit, which was 3000 baht.</p>\n<p>Is teaching in Thailand worth it for up to 15 months of no border runs? Definitely! This was especially worth it to me because it meant that Chris could get a <a title=\"How to Score Non-Immigrant B and O Visas\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/thai-non-immigrant-visa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dependent visa</a> so neither of us have to do border runs during the length of my school contract.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"A_Teacher8217s_Work_Schedule_in_Thailand\"><p>A Teacher&#8217;s Work Schedule in Thailand</p></p></h2>\n<p>In exchange for my salary, paid holidays, free lunch, and a business visa, I am obligated be clocked in at school from 8:00am to 3:30pm five days a week. I am typically there from 7:45am to 3:45pm, making it an eight-hour work day. I teach an elective health class and have roughly 1100 students between the ages of 6 and 11 that I see once every other week. I teach <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/my-typical-day-as-a-teacher-in-thailand/\">five 50 minute classes per day</a>. The free time I have between classes is when I grade papers, which is about a twelve-inch stack per week.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"My Spot in the Teachers Lounge\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Is-teaching-in-thailand-worth-it-12.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"A teachers desk at a private school in Chiang Mai, Thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>In addition to my 40 hour work week, I spend about 10 hours every two weeks writing lesson plans and creating worksheets from scratch, which I typically do on the weekends. As a health teacher, I have few teaching resources (English teachers have more available), so I spend much of my time combing the internet for images with which to create my worksheets and for material-free activities to make my class fun. Needless to say, I look forward to my days off during Thai holidays to catch up on everything. That being said, after a year of teaching, I should have enough material to use again during next year&#8217;s classes.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"Kids Working Hard\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Is-teaching-in-thailand-worth-it-2.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai students in a foriegn teachers class room in Chiang Mai, Thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>Is teaching in Thailand worth it considering I don&#8217;t get paid those extra hours and it imposes itself on my personal time? Eh, this one I don&#8217;t like so much. I think this is felt by teachers &#8217;round the world. But in exchange for a decent salary and a long visa stay, it&#8217;s worth it &#160;for now. Plus, my kids are pretty great!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7707\" title=\"The Reasons I Teach in Thailand\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Is-teaching-in-thailand-worth-it-23.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Smiling Thai Students at an international school in Chiang Mai, Thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>So, would are you willing to spend 45+ hours per week working a challenging and highly interactive job in exchange for a business visa, a middle class wage, and the opportunity to live in Thailand for a year, two, or longer?</p>\n<p><a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"SEE TEFL\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/see-tefl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"thirstylinkimg\" title=\"SEE TEFL\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/banner-seetefl-548x250.png?resize=548%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"SEE TEFL\" width=\"548\" height=\"250\"></a></p>\n<p>For those aspiring to move to Thailand and teach, does this lifestyle sound appealing to you?
