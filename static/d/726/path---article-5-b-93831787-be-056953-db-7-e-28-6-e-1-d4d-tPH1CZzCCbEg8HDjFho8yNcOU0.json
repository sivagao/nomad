Once a year <a href=\"https://stripe.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stripe</a> organizes its &#8220;Convergence&#8221;, a special week where all employees from around the world meet up at the SF headquarters and hack on new stuff together. It&#8217;s pretty great.</p><p name=\"05cc\" id=\"05cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I get to travel to SF every two months and work remotely from Belgium the rest of the time. While I always enjoy these trips, I noticed being considerably less productive over there. Sure, part of it is related to the fact that I enjoy spending time with people I don&#8217;t often see and sure, you probably get used to noisy/busy environments over time but either way, it&#8217;s clear to me I can&#8217;t be as productive as when I&#8217;m home.</p><p name=\"187c\" id=\"187c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;m not a particularly hard worker. In fact, it&#8217;s probably safe to assert I&#8217;m kind of lazy and my willingness to procrastinate is all too natural. Yet looking at the stuff I&#8217;ve been producing this year, it&#8217;s tempting to conclude I&#8217;m sort of a workaholic: I designed <a href=\"https://stripe.com/checkout\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Checkout</a>, a landing page for <a href=\"https://stripe.com/alipay\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alipay</a>, two new entire apps that haven&#8217;t been released yet and two fairly popular side-projects (<a href=\"http://dribbbox.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dribbbox</a> and <a href=\"http://uilang.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uilang</a>) to name just a few. I also gave a few talks, notably at <a href=\"http://2014.ull.ie\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&#217;ll</a> (best conference ever, btw), and managed Stripe&#8217;s design team for a few months. (In case you were wondering, I stopped being a manager because I wanted to keep building things 100% of my time. Turns out I&#8217;m happier managing pixels than people.) Oh, and I&#8217;ve two kids, including a 4-month old baby (turns out these little things require a decent amount of time). My parenting skills still need <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/O7vqj62VeLr\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">some work</a> though.</p><p name=\"7fd4\" id=\"7fd4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Anyway, I&#8217;m not a particularly skilled designer and developer, but the environment I work in (ie: a quiet house) helps me focus on my work. I don&#8217;t have meetings, my commute time is 0 seconds, I don&#8217;t &#8220;grab coffees&#8221; with random people in the industry, I don&#8217;t go to designer meetups.</p><p name=\"e6c9\" id=\"e6c9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Stripe has been extremely supportive for remote employees since day 1. For some reason, it&#8217;s very unusual: most companies are still hostile to remotes, often pretending people work better when physically together. They should certainly reevaluate their position as it limits the amount of people they can hire.</p><p name=\"da41\" id=\"da41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Being remote is definitely not for everyone, but if you&#8217;re fairly solitary and your level of tolerance for &#8220;things that look like but aren&#8217;t work&#8221; is pretty low, give it a shot, you might like it!</p></div>","title":"Remote productivity. – Benjamin De Cock – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b93831787be056953db7e28"}}
