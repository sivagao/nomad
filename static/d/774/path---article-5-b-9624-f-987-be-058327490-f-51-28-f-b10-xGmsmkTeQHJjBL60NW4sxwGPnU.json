While the worlds of Star Trek may be fantasy, the personalities behind the original characters embody several &#8216;traveler types&#8217; that we all are and see in others. Which one of the original crew members would you be if your next trip were on board the Enterprise to a strange new world?</p>\n<p><strong>Captain Kirk</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"kirk\" src=\"https://foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/jamestkirk1.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"400\"><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>James Tiberius Kirk was born on a starship and didn&#8217;t spend too many of his childhood years on a farm in Iowa before heading back to life among the stars. Traveling from an early age, the young Kirk is completely comfortable with life on the road and knows where to find some <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Romulan_ale\">Romulan ale</a> and hot alien woman on stops in between. A natural leader, his travels haven&#8217;t quite freed himself from some prejudices about the races he has encountered. </p>\n<p><strong>Spock</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"spock\" src=\"https://foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/spock_22671.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"400\"><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Spock travels not for the adventure but the science. Spock would be the person enters a field where travel is part of the job studying cultures in the process. He&#8217;d also <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2009/04/07/good-alternatives-to-hotels-and-hostels/\">couch surf</a> and have an extremely efficient set of <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2007/09/06/small-travel-essentials/\">travel essentials</a>. Spock would find more than <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2007/11/19/33-ways-to-green-your-travels/\">33 ways to travel green</a> and his human side would ensure that his efficient travel plans were <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2008/06/04/develop-your-travel-efficiency-and-harmonize-your-planning-and-spontaneity\">spontaneous enough to maintain inner harmony</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Dr. McCoy</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"mccoy\" src=\"https://foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/mccoy1.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"400\"><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>A reluctant traveler, Dr. Leonard McCoy has a gritty exterior but inside has a deep compassion for humanity. This desire to help others overpowers his fears and anxiety about the technologies of traveling in the 23rd century, like transporters and shuttle craft. Much like <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2009/03/06/15-travel-related-things-about-me/\">many</a> <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2009/03/06/15-travel-related-things-about-me/comment-page-1/#comment-35682\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2009/03/06/15-travel-related-things-about-me/comment-page-1/#comment-37211\">us</a> who have a <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2008/06/18/relieve-your-flying-anxiety-without-relying-on-the-statistics/\">fear of flying</a> but put up with it reluctantly. Dr. McCoy isn&#8217;t traveling to relax or see the sights, he&#8217;s more interested in <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2007/04/24/penguin-ecotourism/\">ecotourism</a> or volunteering wherever he goes.</p>\n<p><strong>The Rest Of The Crew</strong></p>\n<p>The rest of the Enterprise&#8217;s senior staff are interesting characters that are drawn to traveling in various ways.
