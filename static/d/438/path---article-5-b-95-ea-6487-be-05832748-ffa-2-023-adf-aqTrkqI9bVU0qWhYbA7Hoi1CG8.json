I love the never-ending activities, gorgeous beaches, a plethora of wildlife, delicious food, and friendly people. The country may be firmly on the tourist trail and expensive by regional standards but that doesn&#8217;t make this country any less amazing. The beaches feel like paradise, there&#8217;s great surfing, diving, and plenty of places to get away from the hoards of retired Americans that live here. There is always a quiet spot to be found if you look. Moreover, the local food uses a variety of spices and flavors that excite your mouth. I really can&#8217;t say enough good things about this country. It&#8217;s a place I happily revisit often!</p><p>Located on the Caribbean coast, this city is popular with expats and backpackers because of its great beaches, surf, and party atmosphere. It is one of my favorite towns in the country because its Rasta influence makes it very different than the rest of Costa Rica.</p><p>Corcovado National Park is on the remote Osa Peninsula. It&#8217;s rugged, quiet, and off the beaten path destination. Here you&#8217;ll find pristine jungles, trails, and diving. The peninsula is still not easy to get to but it&#8217;s the highlight of the country for me.</p><p>The volcanoes are among the country&#8217;s top tourist attractions. Arenal was famous for the lava eruptions but that stopped in 2010. There&#8217;s still beautiful trails nearby though. Irazu is known for its astonishing green-blue lake in one of its craters, while there is a boiling acid lake within a crater of the Poas Volcano.</p><p>(Click the title to expand the text)</p><h5>1. Visit San Jos&#233;</h5><p>Costa Rica&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/san-jose/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">capital</a> is located in the center of the country making it a great hub. Overall, the city only requires a few days. It&#8217;s sort of gritty and there&#8217;s not a whole lot to do. Visit the Museum of Contemporary Art &amp; Design to check out the future of Costa Rican art, the magnificent Teatro Nacional to take in its d&#233;cor, and the history museum located in the town center too.</p><h5>2. Zip through the rainforest canopy</h5><p>The highest 10% of a rainforest is where most activity takes place. By going on a zip-line tour, you can have a hair-raising close view of these vast forests. There are dozens of companies offering tours throughout the country, though Monteverde is my favorite place to do it. Expect to pay around 30,000 CRC.</p><h5>3. Explore Baru National Wildlife Refuge</h5><p>With 800 acres of land, seven kilometers of walking trails, and three kilometers of fantastic beaches, this refuge is another prime example of Costa Rica&#8217;s natural beauty. Birdwatching, canopy tours, and walking tours are the main attractions in the park.</p><h5>4. Wander around Jaco</h5><p>Jaco was once a sleepy resort town whose main attraction was its excellent surfing, but growing tourism has transformed it into a haven of beach parties and pumping nightclubs. Surf lessons and rentals are widely available on the beaches and sport-fishing is also popular here. For a more sedate affair, head to the nearby Carara Biological Reserve to spot scarlet macaws, armadillos and hundreds of species of bird.</p><h5>5. Learn some Spanish</h5><p>Costa Rica is one of the most popular Latin countries for learning Spanish due to the country&#8217;s easy to understand dialect. Programs vary in length and cost, but most offer the opportunity to do a homestay with a Costa Rican family.</p><h5>6. La Paz Waterfall Gardens</h5><p>Aside from the famous waterfalls, La Paz also includes an aviary, hummingbird garden, butterfly garden, reptiles, big cats and more. The gardens are the most popular tour from San Jos&#233; have recently been restored.</p><h5>7. Go sports fishing</h5><p>The country&#8217;s waters are home to Marlin, Sailfish, Dorado, Snapper, Wahoo, and many other species. Consider doing either a one-day or multiday fishing excursion. A basic excursion can cost around 55,000 CRC though prices can by ten times as high for multiday trips.</p><h5>8. Chill out in Santa Theresa</h5><p>At the bottom of the Nicoya coast is the hippy backpacker town of Santa Theresa. This &#8220;town&#8221; really nothing more than a beach with a road lined with eateries, surf shops, and hostels. Not much goes on here as everyone is up early to hit the waves. I like this place as it is a good place to just go, lay on the beach, hang out with people, and relax. It&#8217;s an easy place to fall into and spend weeks. Or, like most people, months.</p><h5>9. Learn to surf</h5><p>Whether in <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/puerto-viejo/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Puerto Viejo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/cahuita-national-park/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cahuita</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/manuel-antonio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel Antonio</a>, Jaco, Santa Theresa, or Tamarindo, Costa Rica has a lot of waves and lots of places to learn to surf. In fact, most travelers come here to surf because the waves are world renowned. If you never learned but always wanted to try and Australia, Hawaii, or Bali seem too far, this is your best place to in the region to learn.</p><h5>10. Walk through the Treetops</h5><p>The Rainmaker Aerial Walkway was the first aerial walkway to be built in Central America, and it is still considered to be one of the top ariel walkways in the region. At the highest point on the walkway, you&#8217;ll find yourself a 20 stories above the ground. Tours start at 45,000 CRC and include two light meals.</p><h5>11. Wander a Coffee plantations</h5><p>Costa Rican coffee is famous all over the world. By taking one of the coffee plantation tours you can see every step of the refining process and get the chance to buy discounted coffee in the gift shops. I hate the taste of coffee but the kind I had in <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/monteverde/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monteverde</a> tasted like chocolate. Prices vary but expect to pay at least 14,000 CRC for a tour.</p></div>","title":"Costa Rica Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea6487be05832748ffa2"}}
