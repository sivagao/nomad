Here&#8217;s what to do:</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>\nAs you pass through the Royal Thai Consulate-General&#8217;s gate, there is a standalone registration booth to the right. It has a logbook where&#160;all applicants are required to print their name, nationality, passport number, and type of visa for which they are applying. <strong>First, stand in this line (#1 in the photo above) and</strong> <strong>fill out the logbook.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>\nObtain a blank visa application form and a blank pickup receipt (numbered) from the visa application area. This is located up a few steps on a raised open-aired but covered platform area with a few rows of chairs and one large window. <strong>On the left-hand side of the window, there is a&#160;line (#2) for the blank application forms and&#160;the blank pickup receipts. Grab one of each</strong> from the&#160;(not so obvious) consulate officer behind the window.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>\nOn the right side of this same window, there is a small blue and white sign that says &#8216;Visa Section&#8217;. Stand in this queue (which may be jumbling into the other queues to sign the logbook or getting the application form) and fill out the&#160;visa application form and the pickup receipt. <strong>Submit your pickup receipt, passport, paperwork, photos, and visa fee to the officer behind the window on the right-hand side (#3).</strong> He or she will double check everything and then hand you the pickup receipt with a collection time and date stamped on it. You are done for now.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 4&#160;<br>\nOn the following business day, any time from 2 pm to 4 pm, pick up your passport with a new shiny Thai visa</strong> from the same window you dropped it off. Be sure to bring the pickup receipt. Remember, the consulate is closed on weekends and <a href=\"http://www.thaiembassy.org/penang/contents/files/news-20151217-102212-807415.pdf\">official public Malaysian and Thai holidays</a>.</p>\n<p>We did our Thai visa run to Penang on a&#160;Monday and&#160;there were about 20 people in the queue when we arrived at 9:15 am. Not long after that,&#160;at least 50 more people showed up. <strong>It took roughly one hour&#160;to submit our application requirements and visa fees</strong> before heading back to our hotel. The next day we arrived just after 2 pm and it only took 15 minutes to pick up our passports. Very painless, indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p><strong> As with any trip to a Royal Thai Embassy or Consulate-General, look presentable!</strong> We recommend erring on the conservative side. Men should wear a collared shirt and ladies should wear a shirt that covers their shoulders and cleavage. It&#8217;s best to not wear sleeveless shirts, short skirts, or shorts.\n\n\n\n<h2><p id=\"Getting_to_Penang\"><p>Getting to Penang</p></p></h2>\n<p><strong><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15913\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thai-visa-run-Penang-Malaysia-1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"George Town skyline in Penang, Malaysia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Malaysia offers a FREE 90-day visa exempt stamp to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Malaysia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many international visitors</a></strong>&#160;so it&#8217;s fairly easy to make this a last-minute visa run trip. This is without going through the added expense or hassle of arranging for a visa to one Thailand&#8217;s other neighboring countries. For example, Americans must pay&#160;for 35 USD (or 1,500 THB) per person for Laotian visa upon arrival (at select airports and border crossings) but to&#160;visit Burma (50 USD per person) and Cambodia (40 USD per person) we have to&#160;apply in advance for&#160;a tourist visa.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting to Penang from Thailand is&#160;entirely dependent on where you are coming from</strong>.&#160;We flew to Malaysia&#8217;s Penang International Airport (PEN)&#160;via&#160;<a href=\"https://www.airasia.com/my/en/home.page?cid=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AirAsia</a>, a budget-friendly airline that often has ridiculously low fares.&#160;<strong>AirAsia has direct flights to Penang, Malaysia from Bangkok (DMK), Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Khon Kaen, Krabi, and Pattaya.</strong>&#160;Our international flights home to&#160;Chiang Mai, Thailand (CNX) from Penang, Malaysia (PEN) cost 2,900 THB (83 USD)&#160;each.</p>\n<p>Public bus routes combined with taxis or direct private &#8216;visa-run&#8217; service vans are affordable options if you&#8217;re coming from Thailand&#8217;s southern provinces. If you&#8217;re coming from the central, northern, or Isaan regions of Thailand, an international flight or&#160;<a href=\"http://live-less-ordinary.com/bangkok-to-malaysia-by-train-penang-butterworth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a train ride to Butterworth plus a ferry ride</a>&#160;are most time effective.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Having_Fun_in_George_Town\"><p>Having Fun in George Town</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15914\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thai-Visa-Run-George-Town-Penang-Malaysia-Collage.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Streets of George Town in Penang, Malaysia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"></p>\n<p>We turned this Thai visa run to Penang into a mini vacation just as we did with&#160;our <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/visa-run-chiang-mai-to-vientiane/\">Thai visa run to Vientiane, Laos</a> a few years back. Once in Penang, we spent the next several days exploring George Town&#8217;s iconic landmarks on foot (with the help of the &#8216;George Town Map and Walks&#8217; app),&#160;drinking the greatly anticipated Carlsberg Royal Stout beer, and eating delicious Chinese, Indian, and Malaysian cuisine in the area.</p>\n<p>Our hotel was&#160;a fantastic find, too. Starting at around 40 USD per night the <a title=\"Chulia Mansion\" href=\"http://www.agoda.com/chulia-mansion/hotel/penang-my.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chulia Mansion in George Town</a>&#160;offered clean, spacious rooms and more free amenities than any hotel we&#8217;ve ever stayed in. This included free breakfast, free tea and snacks in the dining&#160;area throughout the day, a free glass of wine per person every night booked, and free 1kg laundry washed per day.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15918\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chulia-Mansion-George-Town-Penang-Malaysia.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Great hotel in Penang: Chulia Mansion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>For Chulia Mansion&#8217;s best rates, book on <a title=\"Chulia Mansion\" href=\"http://www.agoda.com/chulia-mansion/hotel/penang-my.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/my/chulia-mansion.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Booking.com</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Chulia Mansion was within a close walk of many food stalls and restaurants (several offering late-night dining options) and there was a good choice of caf&#233;s and bars, too. Chris got an excellent haircut at the&#160;highly rated barber shop&#160;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Son-Dad-Barber-1417781818462945/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Son &amp; Dad Barber</a>&#160;before we applied for our Thai visas at the consulate. And although we didn&#8217;t use the services, there was a passport photo shop just across the street from the hotel if we had needed photos.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely worth mentioning that <strong>we had pleasant taxi experiences the entire time while we in Penang</strong>. The drivers were courteous and always used the meter, which was a stark contrast to our trip to Kuala Lumpur! That alone has us looking forward to another trip to Penang in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p>&#160;A taxi from the airport to Chulia Mansion (19 km) cost us 45 RM one way. The cost of a taxi from Chulia Mansion to the Royal Thai Consulate General (4.5 km) was 20&#160;RM one way.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"Easy Peasy Thai Visa Run to Penang, Malaysia"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ee5587be0583274900d5"}}
