It&#8217;s the perfect choice if the popular tourist destinations such as Koh Samui, Phuket, or Koh Phi Phi aren&#8217;t what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18067 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Infinite-Pool.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai's Infinite Pool on Koh Lanta, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"></p>\n<p>We have visited the Pimalai Resort &amp; Spa twice before. Once on our very first trip exploring Koh Lanta in November 2015 and again during the incredible Yacht Week Thailand just a few weeks later. Even now, a year and a half after our first stepping foot on the property, it&#8217;s as gorgeous as ever.</p>\n<p>Pimalai is unique in that it&#8217;s one of the only luxury resorts on Koh Lanta. It is tucked away on the tree-covered cliffs and overlooks the Ba Kantieng Bay (&#3627;&#3634;&#3604;&#3610;&#3634;&#3585;&#3633;&#3609;&#3648;&#3605;&#3637;&#3618;&#3591;)&#160;near the quiet southwestern end of the island. It has everything you could want in a luxurious island getaway including several incredible restaurants, two infinity pools, and a huge beach practically all to yourself.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18092 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Private-speedboat-to-Koh-Lanta.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Taking Pimalai's private speedboat to Koh Lanta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>Our experience at the Pimalai began after arriving at the Krabi International Airport. We were ushered into&#160;the Pimalai&#8217;s plush 10-seater van and driven to a private dock on the mainland of Krabi. Then we hopped in a private speedboat on our way to the 5-star resort on Koh Lanta. The views of the&#160;limestone karsts along the way were incredible!</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>For Pimalai&#8217;s best rates, book through <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/pimalai-resort-spa/hotel/koh-lanta-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/pimalai-resort-and-spa.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Booking.com</a>.&#160;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVi7JJwnYPB/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rainy season?

We received a refreshing lemongrass limeade welcome drink and a cool jasmine scented cloth on arrival. After taking a few minutes to check in, the place was ours!</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Hillside_Ocean_View_Private_Pool_Villa_One_Bedroom\"><p>Hillside Ocean View Private Pool Villa One Bedroom</p></p></h2>\n<p>The Pimalai has a variety of high-end rooms, suites, and villas for all tastes and budgets for luxury travelers. For this particular visit, we stayed in a one-bedroom ocean view villa. It came with our own private pool and outdoor lounge area, which separated the master bedroom and ensuite bathroom from the living room.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18093 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Ocean-View-Pool-Villa.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai Ocean View Pool Villa in Koh Lanta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>The villas are tastefully designed with teak, bamboo and smooth river stones. Our bedroom was spacious and opened up to a romantic king-sized canopy bed with an incredibly comfortable mattress and comforter. Not only were the rooms cleaned every day, we received turn-down service in the early evening, too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18049 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Pool-Villa-Bedroom.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Romantic bedroom with canopy bed and sea views\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>The master bathroom was gigantic. Inside was a giant tub, his and her sinks, a rain shower, and plenty of closet space. You could practically have a private day spa there if you wanted to!</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18050 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Pool-Villa-Bathroom.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai Pool Villa Master Bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Ample amenities came with the bathroom including toothbrush and toothpaste, sewing kit, vanity kit, and shower cap. We approved of the little eco-friendly ceramic bottles that housed the soaps and lotion, which had fresh scents like lemongrass and ginger.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18051 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Pool-Villa-Living-Room.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai Pool Villa Living Room &amp; Kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>The separate living room had a huge TV, a day bed, reading chair and three walls of natural light. What isn&#8217;t pictured above are the second bathroom and a small but fully equipped kitchen. It had a large fridge, stove and oven, sink, microwave, and a single-serving espresso maker. We put that espresso maker to good use every morning!</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18052 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Pool-Villa-Sea-Views.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Koh Lanta Resort: Pimalai Pool Villa with Sea Views of the Andaman Sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>Outside on the veranda was a small breakfast table for two and another chaise. The bedroom had two additional&#160;lounge chairs with our own private view of the sea.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Beach_Views_Infinity_Pools_and_Manicured_Grounds\"><p>Beach Views, Infinity Pools, and Manicured Grounds </p></p></h2>\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/pimalai-resort-spa/hotel/koh-lanta-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pimalai Resort &amp; Spa</a> is built into the jungle-covered limestone cliffs and maintains a feeling of &#8216;peace, serenity, and solitude.&#8217;</strong>&#160;The property is dotted with thatched-roof pavilions that blend seamlessly into the jungle grounds that are gorgeously manicured. Walking paths wind throughout the resort and there is plenty of beachfront property to explore.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18071 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Resort-Spa-Overlooking-Ba-Kantieng-Bay.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai Resort &amp; Spa Overlooking Ba Kantieng Bay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>Our favorite places to relax were at the infinity pools. How could we not love them? There are gorgeous views while laying on plush lounge chairs and day beds. Staff offered ice water while we lounged around and took our orders for poolside cocktails and snacks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18059 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ba-Kantieng-Beach.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ba Kantieng Beach in Koh Lanta, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Another highlight was, of course, the beach itself! <strong>Ba Kantieng Beach, with its crescent-shaped bay, was not only gorgeous to look at while swimming in the infinity pools, but absolutely lovely to walk along.</strong> It&#8217;s effortless to have a relaxing beach day because Pimalai provides umbrellas, lounge chairs, and beach towels free to its guests.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Incredible_Thai_Western_Dining_Options\"><p>Incredible Thai &amp; Western Dining Options</p></p></h2>\n<p>As much fun as it is to sample whatever tasty meals local restaurants have to offer, sometimes it&#8217;s a welcomed change to enjoy what&#8217;s right at arm&#8217;s reach without having to leave the resort.</p>\n<p>The Pimalai has four onsite restaurants: Seven Seas Wine Bar, The Banyan Tree Poolside Cafe, Spice and Rice, and Rak Talay. The dining atmosphere ranges from fine dining to casual beachside eatery. <strong>Each restaurant offers its own unique dining options and the menus have a nice selection of both Thai and Western dishes.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18102 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Thai-food-collage.png?resize=1000%2C668&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thai Food at the Pimalai Resort &amp; Spa on Koh Lanta, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\"></p>\n<p>Pimalai&#8217;s food was delish! We ate mostly Thai dishes and got our fill of the local seafood. The red curry with duck, pineapple fried rice, and seafood salad with shrimp, mussels, scallops, and squid were among our favorites. There are also European options available such as pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and salads.</p>\n<p>Pimalai also has a phenomenal Western breakfast buffet every morning with views of the Andaman Sea. There was nothing more satisfying than starting off the day with a fresh cappuccino and plenty of pastries and tropical fruit. They also had one of the best egg stations we&#8217;ve ever had.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18060 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Western-Breakfast.jpg?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Western breakfast at the Pimalai Resort &amp; Spa on Koh Lanta, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\"></p>\n<p>And if those restaurants aren&#8217;t enough, Pimalai also provides a multitude of dining options. There&#8217;s room service, which has options ranging from breakfast in bed to late night snacks. There&#8217;s also @Home Dining&#8221; option in which staff will bring a BBQ to your room or villa and grill all sorts of meats, seafood, and vegetables. Lastly, if we had wanted to cook in our kitchen, staff will even deliver groceries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p>&#160;One of our favorite cocktails in all of Thailand is Pimalai&#8217;s Coconut Dream. It is made of Malibu Rum, Vodka, coconut milk, pineapple juice, and lime juice. You&#8217;ve gotta try it!\n\n\n\n<h2><p id=\"Resort_Activities\"><p>Resort Activities</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18072 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pimalai-Spa-in-Koh-Lanta.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pimalai Spa in Koh Lanta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Pimalai&#160;Resort &amp; Spa offers an array of activities for hotel guests to enjoy during their downtime, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Pimalai Spa</strong><br>\nSpa treatments are a must on a tropical island!
