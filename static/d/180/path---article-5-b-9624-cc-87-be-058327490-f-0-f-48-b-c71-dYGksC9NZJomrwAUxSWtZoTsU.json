It&#8217;s a blog that I&#8217;ll be updating once a month and focuses all on preparing and taking trips with your dog, cat, and other animals. If you&#8217;d like to submit a guest (pet related) post please <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/contact/\">contact me</a>.</p>\n<p>(Travel bloggers interested in being added to the <a href=\"http://howtotravelwithpets.com/links/\">How To Travel With Pets links</a> page, just <a href=\"http://howtotravelwithpets.com/contact-us/\">send me an email</a>.)</p>\n \n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a lot of traveling coming up around the US before heading to Europe. The best way to keep in touch with me, get blog updates, and the inside scoop on my next contest is to subscribe to my <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/contact/newsletter/\">bi-monthly newsletter</a>:</p>\n              <p>Subscribe to my newsletter below:</p>\n\n\nName:\n\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://forms.aweber.com/form/displays.htm?id=bCyc7Jws\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I&#8217;m looking forward to sharing some new blogs with you starting next week. In the meantime feel free to drop some comments letting me know what you&#8217;re up to, where you&#8217;re traveling, and what you&#8217;re working on.</p>\n<p>[photo by: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/91524358@N00/\">elasticcamel</a>]</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"What Iâ€™ve Been Up To Recently"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9624cc87be058327490f0f"}}
