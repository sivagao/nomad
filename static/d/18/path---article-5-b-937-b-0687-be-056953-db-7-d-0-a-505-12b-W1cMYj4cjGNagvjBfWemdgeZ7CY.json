Your mileage may&#160;vary.<p name=\"9fc8\" id=\"9fc8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This is my average total monthly spending from one year living in Seattle&#8217;s Capitol Hill, one year living in San Francisco&#8217;s Upper Haight, one year traveling to 20 countries, and one month at a hotel in Bali. It is much cheaper for me to travel. Since the majority of my costs are from trains and flights, it&#8217;s significantly cheaper if I stay in one place.</p><p name=\"8e08\" id=\"8e08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">My friends in San Francisco and Seattle often ask me: &#8220;How can you afford to travel so much?&#8221; I can&#8217;t afford not to travel. I&#8217;m bootstrapping a company and living in San Francisco was draining my savings.</p><p name=\"6325\" id=\"6325\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-neighborhoods-where-one-bedrooms-are-expensive-2014-8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco&#8217;s median rent is now $3,120 per month</a>. My total cost to travel all over the world and live the life of my dreams averages to $2,921 per month. I&#8217;m living in Bali right now for $1,200 per month. <a href=\"http://nomadlist.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The total cost of living in Chiang Mai, Thailand is $641 per month</a>.</p><h3 name=\"820f\" id=\"820f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Traveling makes me more productive</h3><p name=\"944f\" id=\"944f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">When I first started traveling, I was a great tourist, taking pictures of everything and doing all the activities listed in tour guides. After a couple of exhausting weeks it occurred to me that I&#8217;m not on vacation. This is my life now. I slowed down and realized that if I have a month to explore a new city, I don&#8217;t need to do it all at once. I can explore the city for a few hours and still get a lot of work done.</p><p name=\"4ffd\" id=\"4ffd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was surprised to find out that I&#8217;m significantly more productive while traveling. But it makes sense. If I&#8217;m only in Rome for a week, why would I waste my time on Facebook? Being constantly surrounded by novelty reduces my boredom and increases my focus, and even <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/travel-that-keeps-the-heart-and-brain-healthy-2014-01-15\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">makes me feel healthier and more creative</a>.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K79uncJ9Ftj65tHejp4Jug.png\">My productivity in Seattle in June vs traveling in September, measured with RescueTime<p name=\"aab0\" id=\"aab0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I went back to Seattle in June to work next to my co-founder and hash out long-term plans. My development time was surprisingly less productive than while traveling. I was sitting at the computer just as much, but was more easily distracted by internet and TV. And even though I was in 6 different cities in September, I managed to work extremely productive 48 hour weeks. Being more focused while working gives me more time to enjoy the rest of my life, so this is huge for me.</p><h3 name=\"cc1b\" id=\"cc1b\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">9&#8211;5 is not&#160;optimal</h3><p name=\"2d96\" id=\"2d96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Instead of working during the daylight hours and pushing all my free time to the worst part of the day, I prefer to enjoy the days and work at night. I get out of bed faster when I&#8217;m excited to go out, and when I don&#8217;t have to commute there&#8217;s just more time in the day. I like to work 7 days a week with flexible hours so I can take a day off when I please or enjoy an empty movie theater at 2pm.</p><p name=\"ac52\" id=\"ac52\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I wasted a lot of time when I worked in an office because of commuting and the massive distraction that is the internet. Now I spread my work throughout the day and take big breaks for exploring. After working for a few hours, I reach a milestone and explore the city until I want to get back to work. Or if I hit a problem I can&#8217;t figure out, I <a href=\"http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/20188-got-creative-block-get-out-of-your-office-and-go-for-a-walk\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">walk it off until I&#8217;ve solved it</a>. Cycling between fun and work makes my days less exhausting and makes me less prone to burnout.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qlzvhUw6cCzEjO8YfBZ09g.png\">Gray: Unproductive time, Red: Productive time, Green: Fun&#160;time<p name=\"5371\" id=\"5371\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">My stay at <a href=\"http://liv.it\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Livit</a> in Bali was the most productive time of my life. It&#8217;s an integrated co-living and co-working space, with all meals provided, so I could focus on my work and not worry about anything. And it&#8217;s all inclusive for $1500 per month, less than just the rent in most major tech cities.
