Lubeck gave one heck of a fight before bowing out to <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2011/03/15/the-best-city-to-visit-travel-tournament-2011-sweet-16/comment-page-1/#comment-151885\">tournament favorite</a> Istanbul; while again Florence and Rio quietly advanced to the the round of 8. You may have noticed the figures changed quite a bit at the end, that was because I had to remove a number of invalid votes (aka. cheaters). For the rest of the tournament you&#8217;ll have to <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/wp-register.php\">register to vote</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"best city to visit elite 8\" src=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/best-city-to-visit-2011-elite-8.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"441\"></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>You MUST first <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/wp-register.php\">register here to vote</a>.
