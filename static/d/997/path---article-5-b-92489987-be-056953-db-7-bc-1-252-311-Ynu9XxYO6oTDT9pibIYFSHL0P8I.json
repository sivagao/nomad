I want to create a Tokyo street scene in 3d. I've never done any 3d before. A day ago, I <a href=\"http://levels.io/learning-3d-day-29/\">learnt how to make glass</a> and reflectives.</p> <p>Today was doing some more grunt work. I did my first <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/levelsio/v/52304057\" class=\"broken_link\">live stream of today on Twitch</a> and you can watch it.</p> <h2>Doors</h2> <p>I added more two more doors to the right side of the shops.</p> <p>I copied the one I already had on the front right (the silver paneling with paper background)</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/day-25-door-bars.jpg\" alt=\"day-25-door bars\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6000 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And changed things around a bit and added some glass and put them in the restaurants fronts:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-03-restaurant-front.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-03-restaurant front\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5994 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And the other one:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-04-render4.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-04-render4\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5987 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This was simply a matter of copy pasting lots of little panels and adding a wall of glass with a wall of paper behind it.</p> <h2>Fold down door</h2> <p>I also added a fold down door between the restaurant and the wooden front:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-04-render4.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-04-render4\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5987 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This was really fun. To make the angled fold down door I thought I'd just duplicate lots of little rotated bars. But <a href=\"//twitter.com/flowen_nl\">@flowen_nl</a> taught me there's a group layer tool for that called Cloner:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cinema-4D-Blend-Clone-Tutorial.jpg\" alt=\"Cinema-4D-Blend-Clone-Tutorial\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6001 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You simply make one object and put that inside the Cloner group layer:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-04-20.32.40.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-04 20.32.40\" width=\"1118\" height=\"96\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6006 responsively-lazy\"> <p>...and your one object duplicates:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-04-20.33.48.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-04 20.33.48\" width=\"2108\" height=\"1554\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6004 responsively-lazy\"> <p>In this case I made one bar and it duplicated vertically to become a door. I also rotated it slightly. You can tweak lots of parameters:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-04-20.32.45.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-04 20.32.45\" width=\"1152\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6005 responsively-lazy\"> <p>But you can go crazier by rotating the X axis inside the Cloner:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-04-20.33.55.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-04 20.33.55\" width=\"1940\" height=\"1546\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6003 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Or the Z axis:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-04-20.34.03.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-04 20.34.03\" width=\"2252\" height=\"1530\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6002 responsively-lazy\"> <p>The cloner is a super fun and useful tool. I'd saved lots of time adding little panels everywhere if I knew about it before :)</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>This was a pretty quick short day. Here's the final render:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-04-render3-1.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-04-render3\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6013 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Next I'll be adding the final shop on the left deep end of the alley.&#160;<a href=\"/from-web-dev-to-3d/\">Read how I finished my challenge</a>&#160;with a special trip to Tokyo!</p> <p>P.S.
