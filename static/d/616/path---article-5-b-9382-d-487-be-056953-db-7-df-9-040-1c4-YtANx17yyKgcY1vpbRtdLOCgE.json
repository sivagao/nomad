We have successfully built a community that is 100% remote.</p><p name=\"f267\" id=\"f267\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our community covers 30+ countries in over 5 continents across the globe. We have successfully delivered on over 250 different projects for some major organizations including <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Uber </strong>and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Dominos</strong>.</p><p name=\"1d93\" id=\"1d93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote working is the future of work. If you do not start hiring &#8216;digital nomads&#8217;, your company will die.</p><p name=\"1d88\" id=\"1d88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We have made the mistakes so you do not have to. We have conducted 4000+ interviews, we have hired 400+ members and we have had to fire 10.</p><p name=\"a145\" id=\"a145\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By following this interview guide, you will know what traits to look for to hire the world&#8217;s best talent.</p><p name=\"cf4b\" id=\"cf4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Your interview process has to be consistent and it has to be via video. You have the opportunity to hire the best talent worldwide and video chat is the only feasable way to allow for a personal touch.</p><p name=\"5b43\" id=\"5b43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t just do one stage. Famously, they say that interviewers know if they want to hire a candidate within the first 5 seconds, we do not believe this with regards to &#8216;digital nomads&#8217;. You have full control and we advise a minimum of a two stage interview process.</p><p name=\"37e1\" id=\"37e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Along with the video interviews, set a task. When a candidate is willing to prove their ability before receiving a job offer, you know that they are keen to work for you. You are also able to see the quality of their work and whether it is a correct fit for your business.</p><p name=\"7e54\" id=\"7e54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At <a href=\"http://indiez.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indiez</a>, we implemented tasks as part of the process for non-tech roles within our company. It allowed us to get a real feel for the candidates and whether they fit within our hard working culture.</p><p name=\"5300\" id=\"5300\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Giving an independent slightly vague task is easy to think of. For example, If you are hiring a content writer, just ask them to write a small blog on a topic interest and let them figure out the rest.</p><p name=\"8ad5\" id=\"8ad5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What should I be looking for?</strong></p><p name=\"2fa5\" id=\"2fa5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">#1 Self Starters</strong></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*MN727dBAj8__etPE\"><p name=\"927b\" id=\"927b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why is this important?</strong></p><p name=\"54b0\" id=\"54b0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote work is all about independence. It is therefore incredibly important that the right candidate is a self-starter.</p><p name=\"3d9f\" id=\"3d9f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They will be async a lot of times and they have to be a doer and not a teller. There can be worries when creating a 100% remote work team and if you can see that the candidate has enough about them to motivate themselves, the rest of their team will have nothing to worry about.</p><p name=\"a3d8\" id=\"a3d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An element of <a href=\"http://indiez.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indiez</a> incredible success with telecommuting comes from having managers who do not have the need to micromanage. Though this can come from our managers style, it works because their team can be trusted and we learnt it from the initial interview process.</p><p name=\"21bb\" id=\"21bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To decipher whether they have this quality, you need to find out whether they are capable of taking responsibility and whether they have the ability to finish something to the end.</p><h3 name=\"5997\" id=\"5997\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Ask Questions Such&#160;As:</h3><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"4556\" id=\"4556\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h3\">Give me an example of when you were responsible for the product and how it occurred from start to end.</li><li name=\"c99f\" id=\"c99f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Give me an example of when you screwed up and needed to rectify things yourself.</li><li name=\"cd5a\" id=\"cd5a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Then drill short questions from the answers given! Why did it happen? Who&#8217;s fault was it?</li></ul><p name=\"82af\" id=\"82af\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">A clever technique that I use, is reactive responses. You want to ask about a time they experienced an injustice, and then empathize with the unfairness. You say, &#8216;Are you kidding? That&#8217;s crazy. What a jerk.&#8217; Owners will immediately respond with something like, &#8216;Yeah, but I recognized it wasn&#8217;t worth my time to complain about it.&#8217; They won&#8217;t buy in and double down on venting or complaining,&#8221;</p><p name=\"a156\" id=\"a156\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">#2 The Communicators</strong></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*OX6dPsmDMbzPoXqV\"><p name=\"73d2\" id=\"73d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why is this important?</strong></p><p name=\"53af\" id=\"53af\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When hiring remotely, communication is the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">most important</strong> factor.</p><p name=\"947b\" id=\"947b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You will not be able to walk up to someone in an office and just discuss any issues in your working day so they need to communicate as effectively as you can.</p><p name=\"6d95\" id=\"6d95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You also cannot just leave things open ended as then it will lead to confusion and because of asyncness and the person may not respond in time. You also will have deadlines that they need to meet and there is nothing worse when a deadline isn&#8217;t hit due to miscommunication.</p><p name=\"5ed4\" id=\"5ed4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Communication is now so easy with remote work. We use loads of tools at <a href=\"http://indiez.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indiez</a> including <a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skype</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Whatsapp</a> for instant messaging/video chats and <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AirTable</a> and <a href=\"https://asana.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asana</a> for communicating tasks and progress of tasks. I have phone calls with my team daily during the working week despite different time zones, this is perfectly easy in today&#8217;s world.</p><p name=\"9b54\" id=\"9b54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How do I find the best communicators for me?</strong></p><p name=\"8206\" id=\"8206\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is easy to check. How well are they writing? How well are they speaking? Are they being clear? Are they writing in detail?</p><p name=\"9550\" id=\"9550\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You will know what is right for you with regards to communication but we give extra bonuses to people who conduct themselves well when they interject, people who send thank you notes following a conversation, people who are graceful, efficient and using a few words to be whip-smart.</p><p name=\"5bf0\" id=\"5bf0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Ask everyone you interview about something that they have recently learned, not only do you hear their communication skills but you may also get to learn something new too!</p><p name=\"5e78\" id=\"5e78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">#3 The Growth Mindset That Will Help Your Business Grow</strong></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*rNpDm17J-eDoa-l_\"><p name=\"8b43\" id=\"8b43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why is this important?</strong></p><p name=\"9025\" id=\"9025\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote workers have to learn independently and learn a lot at rapid speed. They are super learners and you cannot track what they are learning!</p><p name=\"6d97\" id=\"6d97\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To make sure the right person is doing this, they need to be experts in the art of self mastery. You will need to check that they are able to learn difficult things in a limited time frame and they they are willing to expand their knowledge.</p><p name=\"86c7\" id=\"86c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Having someone who wants to grow their mind means that they will be generating enough to be a superstar within your business and will help your business grow.</p><p name=\"2047\" id=\"2047\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Ask Questions Such As:</strong></p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"8b5a\" id=\"8b5a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">When was the last time you geeked about something?</li><li name=\"6e79\" id=\"6e79\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What are you reading now?</li><li name=\"02dc\" id=\"02dc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Teach me something</li><li name=\"702b\" id=\"702b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">How&#8217;s your career progressed so far?</li><li name=\"a748\" id=\"a748\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What mistakes have you done in life?</li></ul><p name=\"1739\" id=\"1739\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">This also helps you find some common ground in their interests with yourself and you will be able to build a relationship on those traits.</p><p name=\"dc54\" id=\"dc54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Self teachers are happy to develop more and more skills, you can create a workforce of experts within their departments and even some incredibly versatile talent. A true asset for any company.</p><p name=\"dda3\" id=\"dda3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">#4 People Who Can Get The Results!</strong></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*a67QolFFJKgNqrRA\"><p name=\"bfda\" id=\"bfda\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Why is this important?</strong></p><p name=\"8415\" id=\"8415\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This speaks for itself. They need to hit your targets.</p><p name=\"3056\" id=\"3056\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You need to find out whether they have regularly hit KPI&#8217;s, what they expecting from their future KPI&#8217;s and in some cases you can request evidence on previous performance.</p><p name=\"5ab8\" id=\"5ab8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What should I ask?</strong></p><p name=\"181b\" id=\"181b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You should ask your candidate to suggest how they think you should be measuring their performance at the interview stage. This gives you an idea of both yours and their expectations.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e861\" id=\"e861\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">How many targets have you hit in your last position?</li><li name=\"9e91\" id=\"9e91\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">What did you do to ensure you hit your KPI&#8217;s?</li><li name=\"be43\" id=\"be43\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">When have you ever failed to hit target and why?</li><li name=\"4926\" id=\"4926\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">How did you handle hitting deadlines while working remotely?</li></ul><p name=\"eae3\" id=\"eae3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">From here, you will be able to gage their previous results. You can even ask for backups and if you are happy to confirm this when getting references with their previous employer.</p><p name=\"ac1d\" id=\"ac1d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Final Interview Points:</strong></p><p name=\"5c89\" id=\"5c89\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A really true and brave candidate will ask you whether you have reservations about them at the end of the interview. Be honest and see how they respond to any objections or hesitations that you may in them. This could be impactful on your final decision.</p><p name=\"e598\" id=\"e598\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Always concentrate on punctuality/responsiveness. This links back to the communication <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">YET AGAIN</strong> and also whether you can rely on this person as an employee. If they are late to an interview, think strongly about how often they would be late in meetings. If they don&#8217;t respond fast, how badly do they want the job?</p><p name=\"5f5e\" id=\"5f5e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is what we do and what we look for when recruiting a perfect remote workforce and our hiring process enables us to only<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> hire people who have a desire to create huge impact and change the world</strong>.
