Rooms at this price point include a private bathroom, air-conditioning, TV, and a mini-fridge. On Airbnb, shared rooms start at 10 EUR and entire homes (including studio apartments) can be rented for around 40 EUR.</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; Ios is filled with cheap food thanks to all the backpackers that flood the island. You can eat cheaply with gyros (meat, cheese, sauce, onions, and tomatoes served on pita bread) or other street food for only around 4 EUR. Most meals will cost around 8-11 EUR, including a drink. For a good restaurant meal, expect to pay around 18 EUR. The nicest places on Ios cost around 27 EUR including a glass of wine. If you cook your meals, expect to pay 40 EUR per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; The local bus system only runs in the summer. It costs 2 EUR and runs along the island&#8217;s main road. The local bus only runs until about 7pm after which you&#8217;ll need to take a taxi. More common for transportation are ATVs. You can rent ATVs for about 15-40 EUR per day to get to the beaches and parts of the island further afield.</p></div>","title":"Ios Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea2087be05832748ff82"}}
