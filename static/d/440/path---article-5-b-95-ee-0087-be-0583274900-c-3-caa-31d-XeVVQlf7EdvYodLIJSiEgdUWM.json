It&#8217;s called Phu Chi Fah (&#3616;&#3641;&#3594;&#3637;&#3657;&#3615;&#3657;&#3634;) and although it&#8217;s well-known among Thais visiting Chiang Rai, it&#8217;s still considered an undiscovered place for most international travelers. All the more reason to add it to your bucket list!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17680\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phu-Chi-Fah-Nautical-Sunrise.jpg?resize=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Chi Fah Nautical Sunrise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>The name Phu Chi Fah actually translates to &#8220;the mountain that points to the sky&#8221; and it&#8217;s not hard to see why.&#160;Just look at its incredible silhouette against the rising sun.&#160;But that&#8217;s not even the best part. Once you&#8217;ve climbed the summit, it&#8217;s like standing on top of the world.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17686\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phu-Chi-Fah-Sunrise.jpg?resize=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Chi Fah Sunrise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>For this adventure, we arrived in Phu Chi Fah the night before and woke up in the wee early morning hours (as in 5 am early). Getting to the viewpoint before the sun comes over the horizon is crucial, but in doing so we were rewarded with a gorgeous sunrise.&#160;We watched as the sun&#8217;s soft light poured over the mists blanketing the mountains below, revealing only the jungle-covered peaks in Laos.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17688\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bright-sun-at-Phu-Chi-Fah.jpg?resize=1000%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bright sun at Phu Chi Fah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\"></p>\n<p>We waited until the sun was completely above the horizon and captured some photos in the bright morning light. Most of the visitors left just after the sun appeared but don&#8217;t make that mistake!

If you go, be sure to bring a flashlight to see the dirt path up the mountain. Vendors sell them for 40 or 50 THB, but we just used our phone.\n\n\n\n<h2><p id=\"Cold_temperatures_so_dress_warmly\"><p>Cold temperatures, so dress warmly!</p></p></h2>\n<p>Although Thailand is a hot, humid paradise let us forewarn you: the early morning temperatures at Phu Chi Fah are frigid. Ok, frigid if you compare it to its normal hot, tropical weather.</p>\n<p>Wear a long-sleeve shirt, long pants, and a jacket. If you go during Cool Season (November through February), you can expect weather in the 40s&#160;&#8304;F (below 10 &#8304;C). Wear a heavier jacket plus gloves, a scarf, and a hat. <strong>Vendors wake up early and sell many different types of accessories if what you brought isn&#8217;t warm enough. </strong>They line the main street near the police checkpoint.</p>\n<p>Wear shoes and socks, NOT flip flops. Not only will proper footwear keep your feet warm, the walk up to the summit is rocky and dirty. If there is any moisture, it&#8217;ll be muddy and slippery, too.</p>\n<p>Hot ramen noodles and instant coffee are available at bottom of the summit. Pack a thermos in which to put these hot snacks. Otherwise, they will slosh out of their open container on the walk up or get cold.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Where_to_Stay_in_Phu_Chi_Fah\"><p>Where to Stay in Phu Chi Fah</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17685\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Town-of-Phu-Chi-Fah.jpg?resize=1000%2C562&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Town of Phu Chi Fah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\"></p>\n<p>As far as hotels in Phu Chi Fah,<strong> there&#8217;s only a few we know of that can be booked online.</strong> One is <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/banpakphucheefah-resort.html?aid=373848&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Banpakphucheefah</a>. This basic bungalow is perched on the side of the mountain with gorgeous views of the valley. Prices start at 750 THB (22 USD) per night.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>For best rates, book Banpakphucheefah through <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/banpakphucheefah-resort.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Booking.com</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two other methods to snag a Phu Chi Fah hotel room:</p>\n<p><strong>Option One</strong><br>\nJust wing it. Get to Phu Chi Fah before check-in time (usually&#160;2 pm) and ask around for availability. This works best if you are traveling with a Thai friend. (A word of caution: It may still be challenging because this town is heavily influenced by hill tribe and Chinese dialects.) Due to the lack of English-speaking clientele, the guesthouse and restaurant owners speak very broken English, if any English at all!</p>\n<p><strong>Option Two</strong><br>\nHave your guesthouse in Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai call ahead and make a booking on your behalf. They may have a recommended hotel or you can do some searching online. Other travelers have written about Phu Chi Fah&#8217;s hotels and have provided contact information.</p>\n<p>We went with the second option. One of our friends called ahead with the help of their hotel in Chiang Rai and booked <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/phu-mok-dok-mai-resort/hotel/thoeng-chiang-rai-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phu Mok Dok Mai (&#3616;&#3641;&#3627;&#3617;&#3629;&#3585;&#3604;&#3629;&#3585;&#3652;&#3617;&#3657;)</a>. The bungalows had a small bedroom, a private bathroom, and a balcony for 600 THB per night. <strong>Look at our map below for the location of this bungalow (all of the</strong><strong>&#160;booking sites are incorrect).&#160;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p> Phu Mok Dok Mai&#8217;s address is <b>incorrect</b> on several hotel booking sites. Our map below has the correct location (Google &#8216;&#3616;&#3641;&#3627;&#3617;&#3629;&#3585;&#3604;&#3629;&#3585;&#3652;&#3617;&#3657;&#8217; to see for yourself\n\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17689\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Where-to-Stay-in-Phu-Chi-Fah.jpg?resize=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Where to Stay in Phu Chi Fah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also an area to set up camp. You don&#8217;t need to bring your own camping gear. Tents, blankets, and pillows are available for 300 THB.</p>\n\n\n\n<strong><p>TIP:</p></strong> Thailand&#8217;s buildings do NOT have insulated walls or heaters. If it&#8217;s 45&#8304;F&#160;outside, it&#8217;ll only be 50&#8304; or 55&#8304;F (9&#8304; or 11&#8304;C) inside your hotel room. Be sure to bring warm pajamas (long pants, long sleeve top, and socks). The hotels in Phu Chi Fah are stocked with fleece blankets.\n\n\n\n<h2><p id=\"How_to_get_to_Phu_Chi_Fah\"><p>How to get to Phu Chi Fah</p></p></h2>\n<p>Phu Chi Fah is on the eastern edge of Chiang Rai province in Northern Thailand, so it&#8217;s miles away from the tourist track. Its closest major cities are Chiang Rai (60 miles or 95 kilometers away) and Chiang Mai (185 miles or 300 kilometers away). Both cities have bus stations and an airport. Chiang Mai also has a train station.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17684\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Phu-Chi-Fah-The-Muntain-the-Point-to-the-Sky.jpg?resize=1000%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Chi Fah - The Mountain the Points to the Sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\"></p>\n<h3><p id=\"Chiang_Rai_to_Phu_Chi_Fah\">Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fah</p></h3>\n<p>The best way to get to Phu Chi Fah is to rent a car. We don&#8217;t recommend renting a motorbike unless you are traveling with someone else and are an experienced rider. There is also an option to take a daily bus from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fah.</p>\n<p><strong>Car or Motorcycle Rental</strong><br>\nThe drive is roughly 2 to 2.5 hours from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fah. <strong>Rent a 125cc motorbike for 200ish THB (7ish USD) per day or <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"rent a car for 1,200ish THB (35ish USD) per day\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/thailand-rental-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rent a car for 1,200ish THB (35ish USD) per day</a>.</strong> The roads from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fah are in good condition. The exception is the last 30-minute ascent up the mountain, which is littered with potholes and requires your undivided attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Minivan from&#160;Chiang Rai Terminal 1 Bus Station</strong><br>\nThere is also the option to take a minivan. <strong>There is a van scheduled to depart the Chiang Rai Terminal 1 Bus Station at 1:00 pm.</strong>&#160;It departs from Platform 1, which has a green sign above the platform that reads &#8216;PHUCHEEFA&#8217;. Arrive at least 1.5 hours prior to departure to ensure you get a ticket as the minivan fills up. After a 3 to 3.5 hour drive, the minivan arrives in Phu Chi Fah town around 4:00 pm or 4:30 pm. This gives you just enough time to check into your hotel and catch the sunset. The minivan tickets cost about 150 THB per person one way (there is also a round-trip option that is roughly double the one-way price). They must be booked in-person at the Chiang Rai Terminal 1 Bus Station or with help from your guesthouse&#8217;s staff.</p>\n<p>The minivan will drop you off at the town&#8217;s police checkpoint sign (it&#8217;s red and white and flashes at night), which is within walking distance of several dozen guesthouses. It departs the following morning at 9:00 am from the same checkpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Driver</strong><br>\nLastly, you can hire a <a href=\"http://www.taxichiangrai.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private driver from Chiang Rai to Phu Chi Fah</a>. Typically they depart around 3:30 am or&#160;4 am, drive to the summit, and then drive back to Chiang Rai. Rates are roughly 2,500 THB for the day trip.</p>\n<h3><p id=\"Chiang_Mai_to_Phu_Chi_Fah\">Chiang Mai to Phu Chi Fah</p></h3>\n<p>Chiang Mai to Phu Chi Fah is a 5.5-hour car ride. If you stop like we did, budget your time for a 6-hour drive. Be sure to leave early enough to catch the sunset. It varies from 5:45 pm in December to 6:45 pm in July.</p>\n<p><strong>Car Rental</strong><br>\nSince Chiang Mai is a much farther drive from Phu Chi Fah, we recommend <strong><a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"rent a car for 1,200ish THB (35ish USD) per day\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/thailand-rental-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">renting a car (about 1,200 THB or 35 USD per day)</a></strong>. Only ride a motorbike if you have something powerful and comfortable, have experience, and plan to make this part of a serious road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Bus from Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai</strong><br>\nAnother safe option is to take a 3-hour bus from <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/chiang-mai-chiang-rai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai</a> and then continue following the first set of directions with a rental car or motorbike, a minivan, or a private driver&#160;from Chiang Rai.</p>\n<p><strong>The map below includes all points of interest (viewpoint, hotels, bus stations) as well as ideal routes.</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been to a lot of places in Thailand and Phu Chi Fah is absolutely stunning. This natural attraction rivals our top favorites including the <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/day-trip-doi-inthanon-chiang-mai/\">Giew Mae Pan Trail</a> on Doi Inthanon and the <a href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/three-scenic-viewpoints-phuket/\">Windmill Viewpoint</a> in Phuket.</p>\n<p>If we were to do it all over again, we&#8217;d stay for two nights. Or at the very least arrive much earlier to be in time to see the sunset and then leave the next morning after taking a nap. If you have a full extra day to spare in your itinerary and have plans to visit Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai, definitely squeeze this into your trip. It&#8217;s otherworldly!</p>\n<p><strong>PIN IT FOR LATER!</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"pinit aligncenter wp-image-20298 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Catch-the-Sunrise-at-Phu-Chi-Fah-in-Chiang-Rai-Thailand-6.png?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Phu Chi Fah is among the most beautiful places to catch the sunrise in Northern Thailand.
