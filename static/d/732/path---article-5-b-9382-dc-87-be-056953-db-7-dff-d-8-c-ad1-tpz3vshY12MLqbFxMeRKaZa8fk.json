Remote Year is all over the place&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;literally we&#8217;re all over the world! Remote Year is making it easy for people to work while traveling, and I&#8217;m lucky enough to be a part of the team who handpicks the legends who make up our communities. Our team goes through thousands of applications a day and talks to hundreds of amazing people from all over the world. To help you better understand Remote Year and the costs associated with it, I&#8217;m going to drop some knowledge.</p><p name=\"6ac4\" id=\"6ac4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What is Remote Year?</strong></p><p name=\"9db7\" id=\"9db7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote Year is a platform for location independent workers or aspiring location independent workers to take their remote job and travel and work around the world for a year, spending one month in each city. Each program is a community of like-minded yet interestingly different individuals from around the globe. These communities wouldn&#8217;t be complete without the Remote Year staff, consisting of Program Leaders who travel with you for the year, local Experience Managers and other RY staff who are, ironically, working remotely alongside the community to help create a kick-ass year.</p><p name=\"0b4b\" id=\"0b4b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Community:</strong> When you join Remote Year, you join the community of hundreds of people from around the world with different backgrounds, industries and of all ages who have something in common. They unite over the freedom to work and travel the world. This community is what we call our <a href=\"https://remoteyear.com/community\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Remote Nation</a>. Our nation is the backbone of Remote Year and the amazing people perpetuating this epic movement forward!</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-q1FHgnh24eMWE8aDv_uGA.jpeg\">Remote Year Cousteau&#8217;s Positive Impact event- School Refurbish in Buenos&#160;Aires<p name=\"2a7b\" id=\"2a7b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><a href=\"https://remoteyear.com/programs-costs\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How Much Does Remote Year Cost?</strong></a></p><p name=\"7249\" id=\"7249\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The cost of the program is broken down to a US<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$5,000</strong> down payment which is used to secure your spot on a program. Each month while on the program, you pay US<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$2,000</strong> (for 11 months) which covers five main things:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"8801\" id=\"8801\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">All travel between countries (travel to the first destination and home are on your own)</li><li name=\"1af9\" id=\"1af9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Private bedroom in an apartment or hotel</li><li name=\"d62c\" id=\"d62c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">24/7 access to a workspace with WiFi</li><li name=\"9903\" id=\"9903\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Professional/Cultural/Social events &amp; experiences</li><li name=\"e0fb\" id=\"e0fb\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Exclusive Remote Year discounts in each city</li></ul><p name=\"c3ca\" id=\"c3ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">| So, you&#8217;re just a glorified travel agent? What do I get out of this?</p><p name=\"3eed\" id=\"3eed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In addition to these five main things, we believe our value-add is two-fold:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"9486\" id=\"9486\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">COMMUNITY is the core of our program. The most intangible benefit of Remote Year is the group of interesting and intelligent people you get to spend a year traveling with, living beside and learning from (and believe me, these people are amazing. We hand pick them ourselves *brushes shoulder off*).</li><li name=\"328b\" id=\"328b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">CONVENIENCE of not having to plan for a year of travel, accommodation, workspaces, reliable internet, and social activities so you can focus on work and enjoy the cities you are living in.</li></ol><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VnBZDRfnOFxFSiSac_D5HA.jpeg\">Remote Year Darien showing their Bollywood dance skills at the Prague farewell&#160;event<p name=\"edb0\" id=\"edb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Can I Afford It?</strong></p><p name=\"0e55\" id=\"0e55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is an important question that should be thought about before you even apply for Remote Year (and if you&#8217;re scramblin&#8217; to afford the $50 second round application fee, I would pay close attention to this part).</p><p name=\"b8f1\" id=\"b8f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Think of Remote Year as trading in your rent, utilities and bills for a year of living, traveling and working around the world. We want to set you up for success both personally and professionally throughout the year&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;this includes being able to live comfortably day-to-day. We&#8217;re not going to hold your hand and tell you what to spend your money on, so budgeting is important.</p><p name=\"9dd8\" id=\"9dd8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In regards to a magic number you need to make to afford a year of travel, that will vary depending on what type of person you are in terms of social life, interest, personal needs, etc. Think of your daily life at home plus whatever local influences in the city you will be living. Are you going to travel every weekend because you can? Go out every night? Drink 10 coffees/day because you&#8217;re in Colombia and the coffee is on point? Get a tattoo in every city you go to? (Yes, this is a thing)</p><p name=\"eaf6\" id=\"eaf6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At the very least, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">if you make less than US$39,000/year *after tax* it would be hard to afford Remote Year</strong> and the costs associated with it. That does not include recurring or fixed costs back home (student loans, car payment, mortgage payment, etc). This also does not take into account any savings you might have.</p><p name=\"719c\" id=\"719c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are costs outside of the program fees. These costs are your basic (or extravagant) living expenses. They totally depend on what you decide to spend money on&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;meals, daily coffee, side trips, nights out, shopping, shipping things home, tattoos, soccer matches, music festivals, museums, etc. Spending varies hugely for each Remote, but we get a lot of questions about this, so we&#8217;ve tried to offer an estimation that seems to capture many Remotes&#8217; spending throughout the year. Remotes can expect to be spending anywhere from $1000-$2,000 USD per month outside of program costs. Of course some have found ways to spend less, and some to spend more, but this is a good range to use for budgeting purposes.</p><p name=\"9401\" id=\"9401\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Realistic Cost Calculation(US Dollars):</strong></p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e044\" id=\"e044\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Monthly RY Fee ($2,000)</li><li name=\"56d7\" id=\"56d7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Monthly Personal Spending ($1,000 to $2,000 dependent on spending habits)</li><li name=\"0742\" id=\"0742\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Tax rate on annual income</li><li name=\"791c\" id=\"791c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Country and currency will vary</li></ul><p name=\"35d2\" id=\"35d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Monthly Fee + Monthly Personal Spending = Total Monthly Expenses</strong></p><p name=\"e5f4\" id=\"e5f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Total Monthly Expenses x 12 months = Annual Expenses</strong></p><p name=\"5d8e\" id=\"5d8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Income After Tax = (1&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Your Tax Rate)*Pre tax income</strong></p><p name=\"f250\" id=\"f250\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Annual Expenses /(1&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;your tax rate) = Salary Needed Before Tax</strong></p><p name=\"6c0f\" id=\"6c0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We recommend that you speak with a tax professional to ensure everything in terms of taxes is done correctly. For US citizens, I would suggest looking into the FEIE which says that if you spend 330+ days in a year outside of the US, you don&#8217;t have to pay federal income taxes on your first $100,800 of earned income. Check out a webinar on this <a href=\"http://www.irsvideos.gov/ForeignEarnedIncomeForUS_OverseasTaxpayers_Webinar20160629/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p name=\"8f8a\" id=\"8f8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It must be stated that these numbers will look different for everyone. Ultimately, you know your spending habits, how much you have in savings, how much you&#8217;re taxed annually, what fixed costs you have, etc. In addition, each country is different. Spending power for your home currency will vary depending on the country you are in. I would highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">looking into</a> this as well.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i-sRd0c8v3fKjoFGGZYE3g.jpeg\">Remotes enjoying the views of Belgrade, Serbia<p name=\"cadc\" id=\"cadc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Now what?</strong></p><p name=\"b6f9\" id=\"b6f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now you know what Remote Year is all about.
