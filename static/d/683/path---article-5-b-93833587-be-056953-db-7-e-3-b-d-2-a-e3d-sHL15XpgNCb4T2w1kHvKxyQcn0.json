Give space for flexibility and do not inflate the value of remote work by creating a schedule for other people.</p><p name=\"ec2a\" id=\"ec2a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Avoid creating too much process. If responsibilities are clear, the process will emerge from the interactions of the collaborators.</p><p name=\"24a0\" id=\"24a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you do have meetings, focus on what is harder in writing: bonding, brainstorming, giving and receiving feedback.</p><p name=\"774b\" id=\"774b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Teach everyone how to contribute to the single source of truth, no exceptions.
