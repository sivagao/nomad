While it&#8217;s quite easy to communicate when working in an office, by checking on them at their desk, walking over quickly to have a quick chat, or even exchanging a few words at lunch. Communication online on the other hand is another story. People tend to disappear or fly under the radar, and I understand why companies are still hesitant on letting employees work remotely, but you have to fight against that.</p><p name=\"1c6d\" id=\"1c6d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At KeyPay, we really try to communicate as much as possible. Here&#8217;s a couple things we do:</p><h4 name=\"2e07\" id=\"2e07\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">1. Daily&#160;Updates</strong>:</h4><p name=\"c08d\" id=\"c08d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Like a weekly standup you do at the office, but here it&#8217;s everyday. Just a sentence of what you&#8217;re going to work on today. Sounds a bit micromanaging, but it helps the team know what you&#8217;re doing, and for you to know what everyone is doing.</p><h4 name=\"73d1\" id=\"73d1\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">2. Checking&#160;in/out:</strong></h4><p name=\"1065\" id=\"1065\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Very basic, every time you&#8217;re not in front of your computer, your team should know. So they&#8217;re not surprised to see you&#8217;re not around. Whether it&#8217;s to go to lunch, going to the gym or simply grabbing a coffee, letting your teammates know will create a coalition to your group. As people may also be in different time zones, this can be really helpful to track their schedule. Here&#8217;s an example of a typical day:</p><blockquote name=\"c44a\" id=\"c44a\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">9am</strong>: Good morning, I&#8217;m here now and start doing X!<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">2pm</strong>: I am out now for a a coffee with a friend - will be back in around 1 hour or so.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">3:00pm</strong>: I am back.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">6pm:</strong> Heading out now. I achieved X but didn&#8217;t got to Y because Z. Good night everyone!</blockquote><h4 name=\"b26b\" id=\"b26b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">3. Share things/Ask questions:</strong></h4><p name=\"657d\" id=\"657d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Whenever you have something to share or to ask to the team, don&#8217;t hesitate to shout out to the chat and often people will help or react to this with jokes or congrats, often with jokes in KeyPay and it&#8217;s quite pleasant.</p><p name=\"ffba\" id=\"ffba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">In an overall sense, it&#8217;s not because you&#8217;re working remote that all the interactions you had in real life has to be set aside. I did struggle a bit at the beginning too. Checking in, checking out, I wasn&#8217;t use to announcing what I was doing. But I feel its worth putting in the effort to create interaction in the team.</p></div>","title":"My personal insight after working a year remote as a Designer"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382fc87be056953db7e15"}}
