Something more objective however is Tirana&#8217;s ad-hoc system for pretty much everything, including public transportation.</p>\n<p>You can get to the top of Mount Dajti, just outside of Tirana, by taking the Dajti Ekspress, the <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2010/05/28/exploring-the-heights-of-quito-ecuador/\">longest cable car</a> in the Balkans. There are a lot of options for getting there but only a few that make sense. Here are the best ways to get to Mount Dajti.</p>\n<p><strong>From Town To Base Station</strong></p>\n<p>Before you do anything, it&#8217;s important to make sure you have, or withdraw, enough cash for the journey as well as cable car. The credit card machine at the base station hasn&#8217;t worked in forever &#8211; show up with only a Mastercard and you&#8217;ll have to go all the way back into town.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Albania/Tirana/i-7R7cQcP/0/690x690/P1420892_3_4c-X3.jpg\" alt=\"et'hem bey mosque tirana\" width=\"690\" height=\"516\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash To Bring</strong> &#8211; A round-trip cable car ticket is around 800 lek ($6.30 dollars) and the bus about 65 lek (.50 cents US). There&#8217;s a good cafe and restaurant up at the top that do accept credit cards but I wouldn&#8217;t rely on them, so bring extra cash to enjoy some <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/category/travel/food/\">food</a> as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Head to the Et&#8217;hem Bey Mosque in the center of town. Looking at the Et&#8217;hem Mosque (with the clock town on the left) about 50 meters to the left is a bus station. You&#8217;ll see people waiting around, possibly a bus, or neither. Look for the Linze bus and confirm with the driver he or she is headed toward Dajti.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dajtiekspres.com/new/index.php/en/info\"><strong>Dajti Cable Car Hours</strong></a> &#8211; From 10am to 7pm (winter); extended hours to 10pm during the summer months. The Dajti Ekspres cable car is open everyday except Tuesdays.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trip from the bus station to nearby the cable car station is about 25 minutes. Go to the last stop &#8211; it also helps to sit near the front so the driver can let you know you&#8217;re at the right place.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop Off And Ready To Walk</strong></p>\n<p>From this point, you&#8217;ll have to walk about 10 minutes uphill following signs that aren&#8217;t very accurate. As you walk in the direction the bus was pointing when it arrived at the station, ask every few shops to make sure you&#8217;ve not gone off track. The shop owners are very helpful, often leaving their stores to give overly detailed instructions for the deceptively winding roads.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Albania/Tirana/i-b7Rx7Vv/0/690x690/P1420919_20_21c-X3.jpg\" alt=\"mount dajti tirana albania\" width=\"690\" height=\"518\"></p>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re arriving with a bicycle, get a round-trip ticket up to the top by taking the 3.6 kilometer (2.2 mile) Dajti Ekspres cable car. A lovely 20 minute ride, unless you have serious fear of heights, take in all of the views of Tirana on the way. After arriving don&#8217;t miss the countryside on the far side of Mount Dajti.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meal With A View</strong> &#8211; Although the pizza is pretty good, be sure to get a seat by the window, even if there is a wait at <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/countries/albania-travel-information/ballkoni-dajtit-tirana-albania-review/\">Ballkoni I Dajtit</a>, the sight is spectacular.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Above it, there&#8217;s a cafe that rotates 360 degrees, like this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Other Options To The Top</strong></p>\n<p>Taxi is an option but you&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2010/04/23/how-to-bargain-like-a-ferengi-and-get-a-good-deal-anywhere-on-earth/\">have to negotiate your way</a> there, expect to pay about $15 USD for a one-way ride. There&#8217;s also a shuttle which connects with one of the bus stops but since there&#8217;s no set timing information available, consider it the very leisurely (possibly uncertain) way up. Up, by the way, is the direction it&#8217;s easiest to go &#8211; <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2009/06/09/quiet-ways-to-beat-shady-taxi-drivers-part-1-of-2/\">finding a taxi nearby</a>, especially close to closing hour means bus is likely the only way you&#8217;ll be getting back into town.</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"How To Get To The Top Of Tirana, Albaniaâ€™s Mount Dajti By Cable Car"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b96246787be058327490e5d"}}
