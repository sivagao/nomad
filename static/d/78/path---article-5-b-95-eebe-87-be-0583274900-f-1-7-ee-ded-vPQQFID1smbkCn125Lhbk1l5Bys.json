But it&#8217;s not just any brunch! This gastronomic affair&#160;morphed into a poolside champagne party complete with a live DJ and entertainment.</p>\n<h2><p>Must Do! Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14868\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Sunday-Brunch.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Chilled seafood delights at the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Our visit to Koh Samui had us <a title=\"Renting a Koh Samui Luxury Villa by WithHusbandInTow.com\" href=\"http://www.withhusbandintow.com/koh-samui-luxury-villa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bouncing around to various five-star villas</a> and resorts with our friend,&#160;<a title=\"Mr Scott Eddy Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/mrscotteddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Scott Eddy</a>, but by far the most entertaining meal of the trip was the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve traveled around Thailand a bit then you know that sometimes Western breakfasts are a bit of a joke. White slices of bread with vegetable oil-based &#8216;butter&#8217;, watery ham slices and boiled hotdogs, and a side salad with carrot shavings, raisins, and a squirt of mayo. Yes, it can get that bad.</p>\n<p>This brunch &#8211; no, event &#8211; just about blew our minds. So much in fact that we went there twice during our ten day trip to the islands in November and then for a third time right after Christmas.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14869\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Outdoor-Dining.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Outdoor shaded seating at Nikki Beach Koh Samui Sunday Brunch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Hands down, <a title=\"Nikki Beach Koh Samui\" href=\"http://www.agoda.com/nikki-beach-resort/hotel/samui-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nikki Beach Koh Samui</a>&#8216;s brunch was among the best we&#8217;ve ever had in Thailand. There was a vast&#160;selection of&#160;gorgeously presented food in the outdoor dining area including plenty of both sweet and savory classic Western dishes intermingled with delectable Thai cuisine.

It was all we could do from ordering a third round of cappuccinos! But that would have been a bit excessive, don&#8217;t you think?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14871\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Brunch-Coffee-Champagne1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Nikki Beach Sunday Brunch Coffee &amp; Champagne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>The breakfast lover in us bee-lined for the waffle and omelet stations and grabbed some breakfast sausages and big slabs of bacon. We noticed there was plenty of&#160;quiche, tropical fruit skewers, and made-to-order cr&#234;pes, too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14872\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Breakfast-Foods.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui | Quiche, sausage, salami, and waffles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>There was a carving station that served up leg of lamb, beef tenderloin, and porchetta with various delectable dipping sauces and entire heads of roasted garlic and onion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Carving-Station.jpg?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14873\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Carving-Station.jpg?resize=1000%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui | Carving Station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\"></a></p>\n<p>It was hard to miss the choices of&#160;sushi and seafood dishes on beds of ice.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Brunch-651.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fresh oysters at Nikki Beach Koh Samui Sunday Brunch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><br>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14875\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Brunch-Seafood.jpg?resize=1000%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Seafood delights at the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\"></p>\n<p>Other favorites of ours were the Wagyu beef&#160;sliders, mac n cheese, cucumber gazpacho (surprisingly a must try!), deviled eggs, and beer can chicken.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14876\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Brunch-Plate.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Each week the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach features a different ethnic cuisine at their &#8220;around the world&#8221; table. This is the secret to keep returning guests happy. One of the Sundays there was&#160;Thai food including tom yum tuna tartare, pomelo and crab salad, coconut curries, and little fried wonton-like finger foods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p> The price of the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach Koh Samui is 1,700 baht per adult (55 USD) and includes a flute of complimentary champagne. It&#8217;s available every Sunday from 11 am to 4 pm.\n\n\n\n<h2><p>Poolside Lounging and Entertainment</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14877\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Poolside-Party-2.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bottle Service at Nikki Beach Koh Samui Pool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>The Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach is a glutton&#8217;s dream, but it doesn&#8217;t end there.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because unlike most brunches that end with the dwindling consumption of mimosas in preparation for Monday morning, Nikki Beach is known for keeping the party going.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14878\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Poolside-Party.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Day beds at the Nikki Beach Poolside Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>What started out as a relaxing brunch with a live DJ spinning soft background music slowly transformed&#160;into a pool party with energetic beats as people around us progressively consumed more Bloody Marys, Bellinis, and Screwdrivers.</p>\n<p>We practically rolled ourselves away from our brunch table and claimed one of the sprawling sun beds that lined the expansive pool. Palm trees? Check. Huge white umbrellas? Check. The pool deck stretches towards the Lipa Noi Beach and people lounging get a view of the turquoise waters.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14879\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Lipa-Noi1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Nikki Beach Koh Samui overlooking Lipa Noi Beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s there to do next when the DJ is turning up the music and pitchers of Mojitos and Strawberry Daiquiris start flowing? We tossed aside our beach cover-ups and jumped in the pool just as the dancers came to liven things up. It&#8217;s hard to go home hungry after this feast or sober for that matter!</p>\n<p>We know Nikki Beach&#8217;s site self-proclaims the brunch as a &#8220;must do&#8221; while on the island but we absolutely second their recommendation!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p> Contrary to what some may think, this is a family-friendly establishment. Although there were various degrees of dress and drinking, there were several families with young children who enjoyed playing in the&#160;pool and dancing, too. It worked!\n\n\n\n<h2><p>The Resort Side at Nikki Beach Koh Samui</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14880\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nikki-Beach-Koh-Samui-75m-Pool1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"75m long pool at Nikki Beach Koh Samui\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Anyone can enjoy the Sunday Brunch at Nikki Beach whether or not you are a guest of the resort.
