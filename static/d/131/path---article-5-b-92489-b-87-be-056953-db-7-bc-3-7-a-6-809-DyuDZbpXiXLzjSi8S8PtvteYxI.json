The Product Hunt Golden Kitty Awards are one of the most renowned startup awards in the world, and it&#8217;s a giant honor to receive them.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8300 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/b5291478-8cf3-49dc-b5de-59270cda38ee.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8300\"> <p>I want to dedicate these awards to all the indie makers around the &#127758; world.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"//producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a> kickstarted an indie startup revolution that's still on-going. Where before startups were built with giant teams and lots of capital, the open and fun nature of Product Hunt made it suddenly okay to DIY and launch your own mini apps.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"362\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8304 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"362\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8304\"> <p>By the nature of the game, most of these apps went nowhere. But in absolute numbers, many of these grew out to be real million-dollar startups. Some raised money later (which is fine at that stage). Others bootstrapped to profitability. Like <a href=\"//nomadlist.com/\">Nomad List</a>, which is now valued as a multi-million dollar bootstrapped startup.</p> <p>The implications of this are big.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"263\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8303 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"263\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8303\"> <p>It means that right this second, anyone, anywhere in the world, from &#127758; San Francisco to &#127757; Nairobi to &#127759; Tokyo, with just an internet connection, a laptop, can DIY an app, launch it, get ppl to use it and build an income. And maybe grow it into a real startup.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8301 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Jan-29-2018-23-55-00.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8301\"> <p>Building startups has never been so globally democratized as now.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8302 sl_lazyimg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/source-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8302\"> <p>There's never been a better time for makers to build indie startups than today.</p> <p>Be grateful for the time you live in. And if I can ask you for a favor. Please go and...</p> <p>&#128736; Build something today!</p> <p>P.S. I just wrote a book on bootstrapping indie startups called <a href=\"//makebook.io/\">MAKE</a>. And I'm now on <a href=\"//instagram.com/levelsio\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio\">Twitter</a> too if you'd like to follow more of my adventures.
