I plan on creating a different newsletters and add a personal touch to them as well. A number of you have sent me suggestions about them, and some features you&#8217;d like built into the website. I promise that I&#8217;ll finally get around to them over the new few days. If you&#8217;ve got anything to add, feel free to let me know in the comments or <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/contact/\">send me an email</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/ideas1.jpg\" alt=\"ideas\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\"></p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m planning another summer contest, although I&#8217;m thinking of pushing it back to June or July.
