But what if you are more of an adventure traveler like we are? Although we had to peel ourselves away from the beautiful sands and exchange bathing suits for outdoorsy gear, we found plenty of things to do in Krabi that are perfect for activity-seekers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a hard to compete with the <a title=\"Our Favorite Beaches in Krabi, Thailand\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/favorite-beaches-krabi-thailand/\">gorgeous beaches</a>, but if you are looking for more adventurous activities, here are five things to do in Krabi during your stay.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"01_Kayaking_Through_Mangroves_at_Than_Bok_Khorani_National_Park\"><p>01 &#160;</p>Kayaking Through Mangroves at Than Bok Khorani National Park</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9819 size-full\" title=\"Kayaking in Krabi, Thailand\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Krabi-Activities-37.jpg?resize=563%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kayaking things to do in krabi thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"405\"></p>\n<p>There are many kayaking opportunities in Krabi, but this one was an easygoing&#160; trip though a local mangrove forest. We kicked it off at the Baan Bor Thor (&#3610;&#3657;&#3634;&#3609;&#3610;&#3656;&#3629;&#3607;&#3656;&#3629;) Pier with the local tour guide, Mahn, who was knowledgeable and quite entertaining. We kayaked in calm waters through caves, lagoons, and near the limestone cliffs. We also saw birds and monkeys and had the chance to looked at some ancient drawings at Tham Pee Hau Toe&#160; or the Big Headed Ghost Cave.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Provided:</strong> Life Jackets,Water, Snack or Lunch, Hotel Transfer<br>\n<strong>What to Bring:</strong> Sunglasses, Sunscreen, Hat, and a Dry Bag (for your belongings)<br>\n<strong>Contact:</strong> Mahn (English-speaking guide) at (088) 451-4652, <a href=\"http://www.borthorkayak.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Choke Thara Travel</a><br>\n<strong>Cost:</strong> 1000 baht ($30 USD) per person half day guided tour, 1700 baht ($55 USD) for a full day; 300 baht ($10 USD) for a rower (optional)</p>\n<h2><p id=\"02_Cave_Exploring_at_Tham_Klang\"><p>02 &#160;</p>Cave Exploring at Tham Klang</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9821 size-full\" title=\"Exploring Caves in Krabi, Thailand\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Krabi-Activities-51.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Cave Exploring things to do in krabi thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re into hiking and cave exploration, Tham Klang (&#3606;&#3657;&#3661;&#3634;&#3588;&#3621;&#3633;&#3591;) or Klang Cave is an incredible place to visit. Located about an hour outside of town, this extensive underground formation is home to thousands of stalactites and stalagmites of all different shapes, textures, and colors. What&#8217;s great is that this cave offers a break from the heat, has no stinky bats, and looks&#160;practically untouched inside.</p>\n<p>A trip to Tham Klang is not for the timid! We did a lot of climbing and clambering over and between rocks and walking past steep drop-offs. We got pretty dirty in the process, too. Tennis shoes are a must! It took us almost two hours to visit six of the twelve rooms in the maze-like superstructure, and it&#8217;s one of the best, if not most daunting, caves we&#8217;ve ever been in.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Provided:</strong> Large Flashlight and Water, First Aid On-Site<br>\n<strong>What to Bring:</strong> Bug Spray, Tennis Shoes, Clothes that can get dirty<br>\n<strong>Contact:</strong> Nong (English-speaking guide) at (081) 267-5508; Ao Luek Community Based Tourism Network<br>\n<strong>Cost:</strong> 200 baht ($6 USD) per person</p>\n<h2><p id=\"03_Rock_Climbing_at_Railay_Beach\"><p>03 &#160;</p>Rock Climbing at Railay Beach</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9826 size-full\" title=\"Rock Climbing in Krabi, Thailand\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TielandtoThailand.com-21.jpg?resize=453%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Rock Climbing Things to do in Krabi Thailand\" width=\"453\" height=\"563\"></p>\n<p>There are fantastic rock climbing opportunities in Krabi. We were lucky to be in the area during the annual Krabi Rock &amp; Fire International Contest. We witnessed rock climbers tackle the limestone cliffs and compete on the Phra Nang, Railay, and Tonsai Beaches.</p>\n<p>Solo rock climbers are welcomed here at Phra Nang, Railay, Tonsai! Need to rent some climbing gear? There is a small store on East Railay Beach called Tex Rocking Climbing that will take care of you.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, there are several companies, such as King Climbers, that offer guided tours.

It&#8217;s home to a gorgeous waterway appropriately named &#8220;Two Water Canal&#8221; that features the joining of saltwater with freshwater.</p>\n<p>Elevated above the grounds of the&#160;Klong Song Nam (&#3588;&#3621;&#3629;&#3591;&#3626;&#3629;&#3591;&#3609;&#3657;&#3635;) is a wooden walkway that twists and turns through the mangroves and swamp forest. This was how were we able to access the crystal clear saltwater waterway, which eventually opens up and meets a cloudy freshwater natural pool. Swimming is allowed here, and we wished we had known to bring our bathing suits! We both agree that this is one of the more beautiful things to do in Krabi that isn&#8217;t beach related.</p>\n<p>Kayaks and inner-tubes can be rented onsite. There are also several Thai restaurants and food stalls at the entrance of the Tha Pom Klong Song Nam that serve snacks, smoothies, and fresh seafood, so it&#8217;s perfect for picnicking.</p>\n<p><strong>What to Bring:</strong> Bathing Suit and Towel, Bug Spray<br>\n<strong>Cost:</strong> 50 baht ($1.50 USD) per adult, 30 baht ($1 USD) per child</p>\n<h2><p id=\"05_Island_Hopping_in_the_Andaman_Sea\"><p>05 &#160;</p>Island Hopping in the Andaman Sea</p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9842 size-full\" title=\"A Beautiful Way to See Krabi, Thailand\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Krabi-Activities-17.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Island Hopping Things to do in Krabi Thailand\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></p>\n<p>If you want to capture some gorgeous pictures of the nearby islands, as well as have the opportunity to snorkel (and even some cases, open water kayak) rent a speed boat for the day and go island hopping.
