Currently traveling through Southeast Asia and documenting our adventures along the way on my blog.</p><p>I am an expert on luxury travel as I really enjoy sipping on good quality local wine and I keep up with all the latest fashion. I spent most of my time at the gym or the beach exploring what nature has to offer with my dog.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8100\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Annie-sellupgotravel-pic-3.jpg?resize=560%2C747&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to auckland nz\" width=\"560\" height=\"747\"></p><p><strong>What makes&#160;</strong><strong>Auckland&#160;</strong><strong>a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</strong></p><p>Auckland is a heavenly destination hidden far from the rest of the world, with beautiful mountains, beaches and amazing hiking trails which gives a relaxed feel to the city.</p><p>New Zealand has 8 major wine regions and Auckland is one of them, with the stunning sunny days and clear cooler nights it really helps our wines too bring out their exquisite taste.</p><p>Auckland has a variety of vineyards particularly toward the west of Auckland with all the beautiful mountains and beaches in Kumeu or Whaiheke Island which is a 30 minute ferry crossing from away from city center.</p><p>Auckland has a good selection of shopping malls and nightlife with live jazz music, pently of bars and clubs in the city center. Auckland is the best luxury place to visit and it was rated on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey\">Mercer Quality of Living Survey</a> as the third most liveable city in the world, this destination should be on everyones list to see!</p><p>Auckland is built on 48 volcanos and has around 1.5 million people with a large melting pot of cultures. There&#8217;s always lots to do in Auckland, especially during the kiwi summer from December &#8211; February. Here&#8217;s a good infographic on some non-touristy <a href=\"http://short-term-renting.com/non-touristy-things-to-do-in-auckland/\">things to do in Auckland.</a> Aucklanders are a pretty relaxed bunch and love rugby, cold beer, fish and chips and mince and cheese pies.</p><p><strong>What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?</strong></p><p>It has to be <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/The_Langham_Auckland.htm\">Langham</a>, an exquisite hotel right in the heart of Auckland city, at the Langham the moment you walk into the hotel you feel like you have walked into a fantasy world! They really know how to make you feel special from the point you walk in, until you leave.&#160;</p><p><em><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8106\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/conventions-venues-langham-bedroom_940_600_s_c1_center_center.jpg?resize=560%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"auckland nz\" width=\"560\" height=\"358\"></em></p><p>The hotel has an old world charm to it, with antique furniture giving it that sophisticated yet traditional look. Always check their website for <a href=\"http://auckland.langhamhotels.co.nz/rooms/rooms_special_offers.htm\">special offers</a> as they often have some good deals &#8211; take a look at the &#8216;five star fling&#8217; package starting at US$200 with a buffet breakfast, valet parking and a bottle of bubbles on arrival!</p><p>Langham runs a very popular high tea which is well worth the visit also a buffet restaurant called &#8216;8&#8217; which offers selections from eight different cuisines Indian, Chinese, seafood, sushi, American style grill cooked, salad bar, freshly made breads and a nice section of desserts</p><p>My advice is to have a light breakfast and head to 8&#8217;s buffet during the week for lunch at a cost of US$38, dinner is bit pricey at US$73 from Monday to Thursday or Friday to Sunday US$81</p><p>While you are staying at the Langham, keep fit by using the fully equipped gym, or enjoy an evening swim in the the heated pool.</p><p>Langham:&#160;<strong>Address</strong> &#8211; 83 Symonds St Grafton, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.&#160;<strong>Phone:</strong>+64 9-379 5132</p><h3>Honourable mention:</h3><p>While the <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Amora_Hotel_Auckland.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amora Hotel</a> is a 4 star hotel, it&#8217;s my personal choice after a big night out in the city. It offers affordable rates with all the facilities you need and it&#8217;s a short walk into the central city to the theatres and nightlife</p><p>When we book a room at the Amora we always check on their <a href=\"http://www.auckland.amorahotels.com/dining-en.html\">website</a> &#8211; look under specials and packages as they often have better deals than the third party booking sites. They do have under ground parking at a cost of US$16 per day.</p><p>Most rooms have a beautiful view from the balcony over looking Myers park and city&#160;centre, be sure to ask the staff for a room with the view. Rooms are nice and spacious&#160;with a kitchenette, washer/dyer and the beds are very comfortable. I always book the deluxe king spa room&#160;which comes with an in-room spa bath and yes a giant king sized bed.</p><p>The buffet breakfast is great, be sure to get downstairs before 10am</p><p>Check out time is at 10am but when booking the room ask for a late check out, especially if you have been partying all night&#160;</p><p><strong>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</strong></p><p>New Zealand is well known for it&#8217;s adventure activities, if you aren&#8217;t scared of heights, try the Auckland harbour bridge walk and enjoy the stunning views of the Waitemata Harbour (US$92). Or if you&#8217;re game, jump off the harbour bridge on an <a href=\"http://www.bungy.co.nz/auckland-bridge/auckland-bridge-bungy\">AJ Hackett bungy</a> experience (US$124). Best thing is you get half of the bridge walk included!</p><p>If you&#8217;re looking for something more scenic but still a good adrenaline rush &#8211; try a tandem skydive</p><p>Jump out of a perfectly good airplane from 9,000 feet, with 25 seconds of free fall. <a href=\"http://www.skydiveauckland.com/\">Skydive Auckland</a> has a beautiful drop zone which lets you see Auckland city from a unique birds eye view (US$229)&#160;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8108\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Herald-Pic1.jpg?resize=460%2C230&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to auckland nz\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\"></p><p><strong>Where are the best hang outs during the day?</strong></p><p>Auckland has many options when it comes to beaches here are my 2 favorites</p><p>Waiheke Island is amazing for a day trip, its only 35 minutes away from Auckland, hop on a ferry from downtown (USD$35 return).
