It was a guide to escaping your 9-5 job in favor of creating revenue streams independent of your time, so that you could roam the earth. It was written for people like me.</p><p name=\"44ef\" id=\"44ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That summer I would jog, ride my bike, or lift weights getting all pumped up to the words of the author, Tim Ferris. Imagine if Rocky were an entrepreneur, that&#8217;s how I felt. It&#8217;s ironic that I listened to that book while exercising because it kicked off a point where I became so inspired that I no longer had time for extra things like a robust social life, or exercise! But then again I&#8217;m a creative and we&#8217;ve never been good at balance.</p><p name=\"fb0a\" id=\"fb0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The next few years I obsessively planned ways to contribute to society that would generate a revenue stream. I started a <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/fe50c304fa6\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">t-shirt business</a> called Modern Nerd, and began writing a <a href=\"http://balind.co/store-design-like-strategist.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">book</a> called Design Like a Strategist, both of which have been awesomely rewarding.</p><p name=\"aff7\" id=\"aff7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At one point I rented a second office because I got tired of working from home on evenings and weekends. All my projects started strong then idled due to time constraints and burn out from my full-time gig.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Svdci8aOWCRJ0jWoccHkMQ.jpeg\">Here I am on &#8216;vacatioin&#8217; in&#160;Vegas<blockquote name=\"db12\" id=\"db12\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure\">Not belonging to an agency this past week, has been&#160;awesome.</blockquote><p name=\"43b7\" id=\"43b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">My typical day this past week saw a handful of hours working, the rest of it spent exercising and catching up with friends, or as some would call it&#8230; &#8220;networking&#8221;. I&#8217;ve seen more of San Francisco in the past week than I have in the previous 10 months.</p><p name=\"c902\" id=\"c902\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now I have a different perspective. A perspective fueled by someone with an entrepreneur deep inside me, someone that doesn&#8217;t need to jump back into the 9&#8211;5 work force any time soon. Someone that values the potential of his time more than a paycheck.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nB4gv5YgoeACnYbQstapjw.jpeg\">Mid-day meeting with my&#160;roof<p name=\"90b9\" id=\"90b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This past week of unemployment has been the closest thing to my dreams of being a digital nomad since I first listened to that audio book years ago.
