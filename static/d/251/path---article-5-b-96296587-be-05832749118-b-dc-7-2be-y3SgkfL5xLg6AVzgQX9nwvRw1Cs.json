I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>What I was up to other than here:</h2><ul><li>Ben left for Kochi to finish up his work and the house was empty except the cat and dog for the first time since my friend Britani came. We&#8217;ve had guests for about two months. So I did what any normal person would do, I pulled out all the American junk food I&#8217;d hidden from everyone and sat in my pajamas&#160;on the couch for a days catching up on months worth of tv. I loved this article by Young Adventuress about being a <a href=\"http://youngadventuress.com/2015/01/travel-introvert.html\" target=\"_blank\"><p>traveler and an introvert</p></a> at the same time, where I saw this photo and was like &#8211; yeah, that&#8217;s me.</li></ul><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8543\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/0faa152e537b3574bc40d3ee76ebe7b7-650x591.jpg?resize=560%2C509&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"map of introvert\" width=\"560\" height=\"509\"></p><h1>Now your story,</h1><p>You&#8217;ll notice in India lots of ads are paintings. I forget to share things like this on here because I&#8217;ve come so used to seeing them that it doesn&#8217;t stand out enough to be &#8220;blogging material&#8221;. I had a couple people&#160;from the U.S. in the car with me and was pointing this out to them and realized it was kind of unique, maybe not just to India- but it was certainly something I didn&#8217;t see back home in Ohio.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6755\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_46772.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"advertisement painting india\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p>Recently, our favorite bar was repainted (Happy Bar in Assagao) from red Vodafone to bright blue for some car ad. I asked Babu how much they get paid to have these huge companies advertise on their walls (sometimes on shops and sometimes on their very own homes) and he said,&#160;&#8220;they don&#8217;t get paid, they get their house painted for free!&#8221;</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it! These ads are on virtually every building in India, and I would be so sad for the people if these huge companies weren&#8217;t paying. Ben told me he had asked this very same thing to his buddy Azad who grew up in Kerala. Az said that they loved the time of year advertisers came around wanting to paint because they got paid.</p><p>Not sure the truth on this one, does anyone know &#8211; share in the comments!</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post?
