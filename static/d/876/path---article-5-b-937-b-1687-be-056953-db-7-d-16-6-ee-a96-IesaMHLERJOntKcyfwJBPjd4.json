Given the opportunity of working remotely from anywhere, I&#8217;ve left my country back in April &#8217;14.</p><p name=\"2ef9\" id=\"2ef9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since the day I've left people come to me asking for a life changing advice on how they can do the same.</p><p name=\"cf6f\" id=\"cf6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They want a change.</p><p name=\"3ae0\" id=\"3ae0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Well, guess what. Me too.</p><p name=\"811f\" id=\"811f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even though I&#8217;ve been pretty much changing places every few months or so, I&#8217;ve been also looking for a change. I wanted to do things differently and I knew I had to step out of my comfort zone so this could happen.</p><p name=\"a82c\" id=\"a82c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">It&#8217;s part of human nature to find a way to make whatever we&#8217;re doing feels comfortable</strong>&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;even when it&#8217;s something that is not common at the beginning, such as having no fixed address. <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/is-it-possible-to-be-a-nomad-forever-ef1d57a47712\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">My comfort zone was on the change itself.</a></p><p name=\"67bd\" id=\"67bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That's why I've decided to spend almost 6 months in a single place. I know, this is nothing for most people in the world and you might be ironically thinking &#8220;uhhh, such an adventurous girl!&#8221;, but for me it was c r a z y. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I was changing places every 2 months over the past few years, so 6 months felt like an eternity.</strong></p><p name=\"46c8\" id=\"46c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was fucking terrified.</p><p name=\"8b51\" id=\"8b51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just the thought of going to the same park every single day with my dogs (yes, I travel with two dogs) freaked the fuck out of me. My comfort zone was back there on the road, not watching the trees grow in Palermo. I didn&#8217;t know how to live a &#8220;normal&#8221; life anymore.</p><p name=\"9fd8\" id=\"9fd8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;How am I supposed to live SIX LONG MONTHS in a single city? Better yet, a city without a big community of like minded people&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;or people who could even speak the same language as me?&#8221;</p><p name=\"5793\" id=\"5793\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After multiple anxiety crisis and flight searches, I realised that this was a form of breaking my own comfort zone once again.</p><p name=\"91d1\" id=\"91d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now that I'm about to get back on the road again, I'm feeling the same as I did in 2014: feeling chills just by thinking about all the places I&#8217;m going and freaking excited about it.</p><p name=\"d9ba\" id=\"d9ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Was it pleasant to break out of my comfort zone? No way.</p><h4 name=\"7081\" id=\"7081\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">But if we need to change something about ourselves, we need to change something around us as&#160;well.</h4><p name=\"9a24\" id=\"9a24\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve changed A LOT during the past few months.</p><p name=\"c89e\" id=\"c89e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This made me realise that what makes me feel alive is not the constant travel&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;nor having a place to call home.</p><h3 name=\"f3f0\" id=\"f3f0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p graf--trailing\">What makes me feel alive is the constant break of habits. It&#8217;s kicking my comfort zone in the ass and doing something I&#8217;m not used to&#160;do.</h3></div>","title":"Traveling the world full-time doesn't solve anything"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937b1687be056953db7d16"}}
