Just do&#160;you.</h1><p name=\"4663\" id=\"4663\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Bangkok, December 8th, 9:30AM</p><p name=\"0b5d\" id=\"0b5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We got an early check-in access to the room with my friend Denice, and finally settled in what would be our office for the net two days.</p><p name=\"8520\" id=\"8520\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">She has a dozen of outfits and accessories to shoot for paid promote content on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/misssdellie/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">her Instagram</a>, and we also have to shoot the women t-shirt line for <a href=\"http://www.doyou.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">do you.</strong></a></p><p name=\"c8b0\" id=\"c8b0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few hours ago, I was still in Jakarta meeting an influencer to shoot and edit a video for, then took a flight to Bali to fix some issues with my staff and get the latest t-shirt samples we printed there.</p><p name=\"1388\" id=\"1388\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Later at 1:30AM, I was in another flight to Bangkok, where I arrived at 4:30AM.</p><p name=\"3d8a\" id=\"3d8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The cover picture of this article has been shot there, from the Pullman hotel G.</p><p name=\"a7d4\" id=\"a7d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I liked it so much I published it as a profile picture on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thomasdespin\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my personal facebook account.</a></p><p name=\"51f9\" id=\"51f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is when it happened, in the comment section:</p><blockquote name=\"3010\" id=\"3010\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;An authentic Digital&#160;Nomad!&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"a8e0\" id=\"a8e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I used to love this kind of label, because it made me feel like I belonged to a category of people who are living the kind of life I wanted back then.</p><p name=\"7260\" id=\"7260\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since the popular Tim Ferriss&#8217; 4-hour work week, the digital nomad thing has been made easier, and today it seems like a life goal for millions of people.</p><p name=\"d1f3\" id=\"d1f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But here is what&#8217;s wrong:&#160;<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">people forget that being a digital nomad is not an end, but a mean.</strong></p><p name=\"dcbd\" id=\"dcbd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I am sometimes living a digital nomadic lifestyle, but most of the time I am based in Bali where I actually live.</p><p name=\"a0a4\" id=\"a0a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because I take a flight to a few places and work on the way doesn&#8217;t give me a specific &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; label.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"10db\" id=\"10db\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">If I need to go somewhere to work from there for a specific reason, I just go and do my things there.</li><li name=\"ed1c\" id=\"ed1c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If I want to go somewhere to visit, explore and maintain my business from there, I just do it.</li><li name=\"dd17\" id=\"dd17\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">And if I want to stay settled in Bali for months to focus and recenter my thoughts around what matters for me, I just do it as well.</li></ul><p name=\"4bda\" id=\"4bda\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Those are some elements of the life <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I decided to design for me. </strong><br>This is where all of my efforts led me after years of trial and error.</p><p name=\"147f\" id=\"147f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not currently mad at people commenting that I live a digital nomadic life. This doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><p name=\"0c95\" id=\"0c95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What matters is the reflection behind and what&#8217;s happening around this kind of trend where everyone want to get the same cool life as anyone else.</p><p name=\"ec7e\" id=\"ec7e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I know people who would just take a flight to Bangkok of Chiang Mai and write a few blogposts from there so they socially earn their &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; label.</p><p name=\"6383\" id=\"6383\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is ridiculous.</p><p name=\"e000\" id=\"e000\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My first &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; experience came when I pedaled 12,000km around Europe and USA. I was taking $200 gigs creating websites from my tent at night, living on a $7/day kind of budget.</p><p name=\"37ff\" id=\"37ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It lasted for 14 months.</p><p name=\"0ce7\" id=\"0ce7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then, I also happened to launch a Startup House in Budapest and an Ecom Villa in Bali, and I also launched a successful drop shipping businesses (I also failed 6 of them).</p><p name=\"18b9\" id=\"18b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today, I am working on my own brand, <a href=\"http://www.doyou.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">do you.</strong></a>, co-writing <a href=\"http://www.ecomwisdom.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an ebook for eCom entrepreneurs</a>, launching my own private entrepreneurs inner circle, daily writing and day trading more than 5 figures in crypto-currencies.</p><p name=\"a63a\" id=\"a63a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sometimes, people call me successful and send me messages saying they want to become a &#8220;successful digital nomad&#8221; like me.</p><p name=\"5953\" id=\"5953\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My ego used to love this.<br>But for a few months already I realized that this is quite bad.</p><p name=\"e9b6\" id=\"e9b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No one should ever want to become like me. If it happens, I got it all wrong in what I am sharing and communicating every day.</p><p name=\"b831\" id=\"b831\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My journey is just the story of another lost teenager struggling to find himself and trying whatever he can to grow up in his own way, learning everything he feels interested by, and trying to slightly improve the world around him.</p><p name=\"4fd2\" id=\"4fd2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Anyone reading those words is way different than me, has much more qualities than me, and way different weak points than me.</p><p name=\"f852\" id=\"f852\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">You don&#8217;t want to become like me,&#160;<br>you want to become like you.</strong></p><p name=\"6395\" id=\"6395\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s exactly the same with this Digital Nomad thing.</p><p name=\"05b2\" id=\"05b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you see it as a goal because of what you saw on Instagram, and if you want to become &#8220;like them&#8221;, you will just live someone else&#8217;s life.</p><p name=\"7afd\" id=\"7afd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Congrats, you failed before even trying.</p><p name=\"b8f4\" id=\"b8f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, you<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>have to understand than <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">everything is just about the journey itself.</strong></p><p name=\"c770\" id=\"c770\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You have to get it that all of this game thing of life is about <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">who you become on the way to somewhere,</strong> not about arriving somewhere because everyone you look up to is there.</p><p name=\"8ca0\" id=\"8ca0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t admire labels,&#160;<br>don&#8217;t admire results,&#160;<br>don&#8217;t seek social recognition.</p><p name=\"94aa\" id=\"94aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Admire who you already managed to become so far.<br>And think about where you would love to be headed next.</p><p name=\"10a8\" id=\"10a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then,<br>just go fucking do you.</p><p name=\"301c\" id=\"301c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Love you all,</p><p name=\"844a\" id=\"844a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Thomas.</p></div>","title":"Whatâ€™s wrong with this Digital Nomad thing?
