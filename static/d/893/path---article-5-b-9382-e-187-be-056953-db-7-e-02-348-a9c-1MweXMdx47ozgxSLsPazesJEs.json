But I&#8217;ve been wondering what to write about&#160;&#8230;</p><p name=\"838f\" id=\"838f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">On a recent visit to Silicon Valley, I noted how there are more than a few major technology companies that are wondering how to make a fully distributed (aka &#8220;remote&#8221;) design team work well. They were all asking me how it&#8217;s done at Automattic. The &#128161;went off in my head.</p><p name=\"1c95\" id=\"1c95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I feel so fortunate to have stepped deep into the territory of all-distributed teams by joining the Automattic universe 22 months ago, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. But I haven&#8217;t had time to really write about the experience. So let me start!</p><p name=\"d169\" id=\"d169\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First of all I&#8217;m using a cool &#8220;WP LinkedIn Auto Publish&#8221; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linkedin-auto-publish/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> so I can connect to an audience I have over there automatically. I had wanted to connect in my Medium account but unfortunately they haven&#8217;t updated the plugin&#160;&#8230; but I guess I can just copy and paste stuff directly over there. (And I did!!!)</p><p name=\"7aa6\" id=\"7aa6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Secondly, I should start out by finding what folks would like to know about remote design teams. Let me start with a rough framework like: 1/ How does it work? 2/ How it doesn&#8217;t work? 3/ How do you make it work better? If I really get going I&#8217;ll open a TypeForm to gather more information.</p><h3 name=\"961c\" id=\"961c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How does it&#160;work?</h3><p name=\"fdf3\" id=\"fdf3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Automattic is a 700-person all-remote company with one key secret to how we work well in an all-distributed fashion: it&#8217;s got to work. In other words, it all works well because it&#8217;s the only way that we operate. We have no headquarters to rely upon, so we figure out how to make-do without one.</p><p name=\"4c48\" id=\"4c48\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few years ago our CEO Matt Mullenweg shared this key thought:</p><blockquote name=\"3b99\" id=\"3b99\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;While it&#8217;s possible to work remotely, there&#8217;s a bonding and a familiarity that develops when you&#8217;re in person together that&#8217;s irreplaceable.&#8221;</blockquote><p name=\"ac7b\" id=\"ac7b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">And that&#8217;s the second secret to Automattic: we get together IRL (In Real Life) throughout the year. We gather in all kinds of places all around the world in small groups and across teams&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and what makes it cost effective is that we don&#8217;t have a physical infrastructure to pay for or any other large capital outlay. Cool, huh?</p><p name=\"464d\" id=\"464d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lastly, the third secret to Automattic is the people. We&#8217;ve got great people who are passionate about making the Web a better place. The idea of safeguarding the Internet&#8217;s global, distributed nature is sacrosanct for us&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;so our values overlap perfectly with how we operate.</p><p name=\"0464\" id=\"0464\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Originally posted </strong><a href=\"https://remotedesignteam.com/2018/06/thoughts-on-leading-a-remote-design-team/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">here</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong></p></div>","title":"Thoughts on leading a remote design team – John Maeda – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382e187be056953db7e02"}}
