Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to Sheffield</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about&#160; yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in Sheffield.</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">My name is Laura. I&#8217;m originally from New York, but for the last six years I&#8217;ve been living in Australia, New Zealand, Korea and now the UK. My boyfriend is British and we&#8217;ve been visiting his family in Sheffield on and off for the last seven years. I love coming into the city and exploring a different restaurant, cafe or shopping spot &#8211; it&#8217;s full of truly unique places.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes </i></b><b><i>Sheffield </i></b><b><i>a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s the sort of place you would never think of when you plan a getaway and that&#8217;s what I love about this city. It&#8217;s only 2 hours by train from London yet it feels a world away. It&#8217;s full of historical boutique hotels and budding new restaurants without the major price tag of the capital.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in Sheffield?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Halifax Hall</strong> is by far my favorite plush hotel in town. An old steel baron&#8217;s estate, the home has been renovated, but maintains the period charm of the late 19th century. It&#8217;s full of rich gem tones and plush beds which you&#8217;ll need after their decadent Sunday lunch.

The rooms are full of luxuries &#8211; brass baths, huge luscious beds, views of Endcliffe Park and Nespresso machines for a perfect morning cup. They also do a lavish afternoon tea with cream scones and prosecco.

My favorite has to be Tamper Coffee. Owned and operated by New Zealand expats, they&#8217;ve brought the best of kiwi coffee culture to South Yorkshire. They also do a killer brunch. Steam Yard is another great cafe that does coffee right and when the weather&#8217;s nice you can sit out in their courtyard.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13083\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tamper-Coffee.jpg?resize=560%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Sheffield\" width=\"560\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Sheffield and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.silversmiths-restaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silversmiths</a> is the best around. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that everything is as local as possible. Cheeses are from Yorkshire, meats are locally sourced, and there&#8217;s an ever changing menu to suit the vegetables of the season. They have a seriously extensive cocktail menu, and a pie and steak night that I thought would be your standard pub grub, but was so, so much more. </p><p class=\"p1\">Location: 111 Arundel Street,&#160;Sheffield,&#160;S1 2NT</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts in&#160;<b><i>Sheffield</i></b>&#8211; what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s so tough. It has to be a toss up between <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SteamYard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steam Yard&#8217;</a>s doughnuts and the cakes at <a href=\"http://www.catlanebakery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cat Lane Bakery</a> (they also do some SERIOUSLY good homemade bread).</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13081\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steam-Yard.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Sheffield\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/steamyard-donut.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Sheffield\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designersin Sheffield?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">My favorite shops are down Division Street in the Devonshire Quarter. The Forum has an incredible vintage shop called Vulgar. Then there&#8217;s Cow, another vintage shop where I always walk out with something because the selection is simply perfection. Head to Fargate for big brands like H&amp;M and Topshop or walk down to The Moor for the department stores and sheffield&#8217;s amazing covered market.</p><p class=\"p1\">Location:&#160;COW Sheffield,&#160;156-160 West Street,&#160;S1 4ES</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13077\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cow.jpg?resize=560%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Sheffield\" width=\"560\" height=\"475\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Sheffield?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.spa1877.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spa 1877</a>&#160;is the sort of place you accidentally spend the whole day (or week). It&#8217;s an authentic Turkish bath, they do massages, waxing, facials, threading and have a huge selection of complete packages which usually include a nice light lunch. </p><p class=\"p1\">Location: 67 Victoria St, Sheffield S3 7QD</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view in Sheffield&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re looking for a really jaw dropping place to watch the sunset, hop in the car and drive west for a few miles into the Peak District. The sun setting over these craggy, green hills is by far the best place to nature spot in Sheffield.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Sheffield is certainly not lacking in pubs and bars. I prefer a few craft beers or ales so usually head to Sheffield Tap next to the train station. They have 11 hand pull taps and I always get a new tasty beer when I&#8217;m there.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-13078 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gravatar.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Sheffield\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Laura Bronner is a writer originally from New York.
