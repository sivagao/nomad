I don&#8217;t think many of us would have predicted this Elite 8 when the tournament began a little over 2 weeks ago. In <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2012/03/13/the-best-city-to-visit-travel-tournament-2012-sweet-16/\">the last round</a> we saw Fethiye literally claw its way to a win against a strong effort by Barcelona; now set to face a quiet Kuala Lumpur. Guimaraes again slips by another round to survive and Marrakesh knocks off New York City. And Porto, <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2011/12/06/discovering-the-art-and-heart-of-porto-the-best-city-to-visit-in-2011/\">last year&#8217;s champion</a> was eliminated so now we&#8217;re set for a new city to win 2012. You have 2 days to select the Final Four, which cities will remain?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Voting in the Elite 8 will be open until 6am US EST this Sunday, March 18th.
