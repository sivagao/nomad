I&#8217;m Carly, an Aussie girl addicted to photography, tea, sunshine and endless adventures. Born on the Gold Coast and raised in a small farming town in country Australia, I embarked on my first solo trip at the age of 14, and from that moment forth I was destined to become the perpetual wanderer, moment capturer and adventure seeker I am now! I never leave home without my camera or sense of adventure and I am living proof that you don&#8217;t have to quit your job to travel the world. </p><p class=\"p1\">In addition to international travel, I love exploring my home country and discovering all Australia has to offer. And that leads us to Hobart! After countless visits over the years, I&#8217;m completely convinced that it is Australia&#8217;s best undiscovered gem!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tasman-peninsula-coastline.jpg?resize=421%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"421\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes Hobart a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Hobart is the vibrant and trendy capital city of Australia&#8217;s island state, Tasmania. South of the mainland, Tasmania is home to unparalleled beauty, rugged wilderness, picturesque coastlines, majestic mountains and luxurious vineyards, and at the centre of it all is Hobart. With its picturesque waterfront, exceptional food and wine scene, provocative art movement and Mount Wellington towering above it, Hobart is not only the ideal home base for all your Tasmanian adventures, but a perfect destination for luxury travel.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14682\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mount-wellington-hobart.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in Hobart?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">You can&#8217;t go past the iconic <a href=\"http://tidd.ly/62b89c54\"><strong>Lenna of Hobart</strong></a> Hotel. Located in the historic neighbourhood of Battery Point, this hotel is a meticulously restored sandstone mansion from the late 1800s and never fails to make me think I&#8217;ve stepped onto the filming set of Downton Abbey. It just oozes old world sophistication and charm! The rooms are gorgeous and overlook Salamanca Place and the Hobart waterfront, which is exactly what you want on a trip to Hobart.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14680\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lenna-of-hobart-hotel.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels in Hobart, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The <a href=\"http://tidd.ly/aa2e9e6d\"><strong>Islington Hotel</strong></a>! Snuggled into the foothills of Mount Wellington, the hotel is gorgeous, unique and very luxurious. Every guest room is adorned with fine arts and antiques, but the pi&#232;ce-de-r&#233;sistance in my opinion is the hotel&#8217;s immaculate garden, complete with glass pavilion and tranquil reflecting pool. Talk about serene! </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Hobart?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Where to begin &#8211; you&#8217;ll be totally spoiled for choice! Some of my favourite escapades (and my recommendations for visitors to Hobart) have been reaching Mount Wellington&#8217;s summit, feeding Tasmanian Devils at the conservation park outside Hobart, vineyard hopping through the Southern Wine Route, boating around Bruny Island alongside fur seals, dolphins and whales, gazing awe-struck at MONA&#8217;s provocative art installations and stepping back in time to Hobart&#8217;s colonial and convict era at Port Arthur. Incredible adventures await in Hobart!

Sullivan&#8217;s Cove is Hobart&#8217;s historic waterfront precinct. Wander the picturesque marina, visit Elizabeth Street Pier to indulge in all the food and wine you can handle and take a trip from Brooke Street Pier to MONA.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14678\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hobart-beach.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\">Salamanca Place is the location for the Salamanca Markets held each Saturday. The markets are a true celebration of the sights and sounds of Tasmania, along with its finest produce so are great for wandering, sampling and picking up some local goodies. Every other day, it&#8217;s the perfect place to potter away the hours as you hop between cafes, art houses, boutique shops and trendy bars. </p><p class=\"p1\">Last but not least is Battery Point. This idyllic neighborhood is home to cute colonial cottages and my favourite bakery &#8211; Jackman and McRoss. Here, you&#8217;ll find all the unhealthy stuff. It&#8217;s delicious.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14679\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jackman-and-mcross-bakery-hobart.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Hobart and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;m going to pick two of my favourite restaurants at completely opposite ends of the spectrum to cover either a casual or fancy date night. For something a little more casual, you absolutely can&#8217;t go past Fish Frenzy at Sullivan&#8217;s Cove. The fish and seafood is the freshest and tastiest I&#8217;ve ever had and the salads, soup and chips are awesome too. The waterfront location makes it even more perfect and&#160; it&#8217;s easy walking distance to the bars at Salamanca after dinner. For a more upscale option, Frogmore Creek Winery is outstanding. The food, beverages and service are impeccable, and the vineyard setting is perfect for the romantics! </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers in Hobart? </i></b><b><i>&#160;</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Salamanca Place is the shopping mecca for art and antiques. The Saturday morning markets are the place to go if you are after anything local, whether it be food, produce or other goodies. The arcades in the Hobart CBD have a fabulous mix of boutique, independent and chain stores, and the area is so walk-able &#8211; you can easily spend all day wandering and getting around on foot, which is always the best way to discover the hidden gems!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Mount Wellington for sure! With its 360 degrees view of the city and the entire surrounding region, the summit is the perfect spot to take in a sunrise or a sunset.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14676\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/grape-wine-bar.jpg?resize=374%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"374\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Salamanca Square and Salamanca Place are trendy places to go to socialise, with no shortage of cafes, pubs and bars all within close vicinity to keep you entertained for hours ;) The fun, lively atmosphere and fabulous live music just draws you in! Grape Wine Bar is one of my favourites!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14677 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gravatar.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Hobart\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Carly Fowler is the avid photographer, writer and adventurer behind the travel blog Let Us Wanderlust.
