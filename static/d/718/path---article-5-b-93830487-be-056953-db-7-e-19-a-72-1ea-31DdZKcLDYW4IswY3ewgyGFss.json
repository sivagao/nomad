It represents a latent discontent with social expectations and a collective veto of what it means to be &#8220;normal&#8221;. It speaks to our desire to take back control of our lives and spend our time how we want and where we want. It represents hundreds of thousands of people around the world who are fed up with settling for lives they are profoundly unsatisfied with. It&#8217;s a yearning to feel inspired again; a desire to live in a globally connected community; and a charge to change what we deem important as a society.</p><p name=\"26a1\" id=\"26a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If this resonates with you, consider this is a call to arms. If you are accepting a new job position, talk to your employer about working remotely one day a week. If you are job hunting, look for companies that already hire remote workers. If you&#8217;re an employer or starting a new business, set up your team with the foundations to be completely location-independent one day. Follow blogs created by remote workers and attend meetups to get a taste of how achievable this lifestyle is. And, if nothing else, just start the conversation with a friend, colleagues, the guy working next to you in the coffee shop, or anyone who is willing to listen. You&#8217;d be surprised how many people are already ready to rally.</p><p name=\"f467\" id=\"f467\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">If you&#8217;ve made it this far and none of this speaks to you, please just pardon our dust&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;the remote work movement is underway. &#9996;</p></div>","title":"The Remote Manifesto – Go Remote – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b93830487be056953db7e19"}}
