Customers in the US can order hard to find phones from Grakomindo and still choose from most carriers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Grakomindo is a sharp and well organized website that features a huge selection of Nokia, Motorola, and Samsung (among other) phones. Especially enticing about Grakomindo&#8217;s selection is that they have even typically hard to find mobiles like the Apple iPhone and Nokia N96. Most of the phones being offered at Grakomindo are tri-band, meaning they can be used in Europe and the US as well as in most other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>Here in the US, cell phones are usually exclusive to a particular carrier, and to get the phone you want you need to sign a 1-2 year contract with a company you may not want to do business with. Grakomindo&#8217;s prices are typically much higher than buying cell phones tied to a plan (for you US customers) and you&#8217;ll have to decide if the trade-off for a select phone is worth it. Grakomindo offers a 90 day return policy, minus a 5% restocking fee on all orders. Their specific return rules are a bit tricky and I&#8217;d contact the company before purchasing.</p>\n<p>This is a sponsored review of Grakomindo.</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"Buy Select Cell Phones Without Contract Obligations At Grakomindo"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b96246387be058327490e53"}}
