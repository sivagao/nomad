{"data":{"mongodbDatabaseArticles":{"id":"5b92489787be056953db7bbf","content":"<div><p>Today is day 27 of <a href=\"/i-am-learning-3d/\">my challenge to learn 3d in a month</a>. I want to create a Tokyo street scene in 3d. I've never done any 3d before. A few days ago, we <a href=\"http://levels.io/learning-3d-day-23/\">added shadows and filled up the street</a>.</p> <p>Here's what I'm trying to make:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makashiwakui_header.jpg\" alt=\"makashiwakui_header\" width=\"1200\" height=\"682\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5450 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Today I focused on adding more big, small and tiny details:</p> <h2>Shaping the bar front</h2> <p>I'm working on the bar's front now. It's a whiskey bar. Here's how it looks on the photo:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-26-20.28.22.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-26 20.28.22\" width=\"708\" height=\"1018\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5798 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It's hard to see exactly how the bar itself looks though from that angle. Luckily, I was browsing and found pictures of the bar from their <a href=\"//www.facebook.com/bar254oyama/photos/\">Facebook page</a>:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/536772_623339564376475_359295516_n.jpg\" alt=\"536772_623339564376475_359295516_n\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5795 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1454656_633949573315474_163636846_n.jpg\" alt=\"1454656_633949573315474_163636846_n\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5796 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11216707_1011925275517900_6809163807209142519_n.jpg\" alt=\"11216707_1011925275517900_6809163807209142519_n\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5797 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Having that reference material around helps a lot. Because now I can see from the side how it looks.</p> <h2>Wine barrel</h2> <p>First off, I wanted to add the wine barrel in front of the bar. This was challenging as hell. I started with an oil tank:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-26-20.34.29-1024x708.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-26 20.34.29\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5814 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Then I removed the top and bottom parts with two cubes, one above and one under it, that I boole'd around. I wrote it before but Boole is a way to subtract one shape from the other.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-26-20.34.56-1024x795.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-26 20.34.56\" width=\"640\" height=\"497\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5813 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Then I added an indent by boole'ing a smaller vertical cylinder on top:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-26-20.35.06-1024x425.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-26 20.35.06\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5811 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Then I added some torus shapes as black bands around the barrel:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-26-20.35.17-1024x636.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-26 20.35.17\" width=\"640\" height=\"398\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5810 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It's not perfect yet, as the barrel needs to be wider. I'll figure out how to make it wider a bit later. Now priority is filling the scene up as fast as possible</p> <h2>Wooden frame flyer</h2> <p>I also quickly made the flyer/poster that hung in a wooden frame under the bar sign:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-6.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled-6\" width=\"426\" height=\"215\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5840 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I also had this reference:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11216707_1011925275517900_6809163807209142519_n.jpg\" alt=\"11216707_1011925275517900_6809163807209142519_n\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5797 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And I found this flyer on the bar's Facebook:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12308703_1013199698723791_5736358923537801963_n.jpg\" alt=\"12308703_1013199698723791_5736358923537801963_n\" width=\"500\" height=\"727\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5841 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Together with those, I got this:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-27-poster-sign.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-27-poster-sign\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5842 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Manholes</h2> <p>Another strong but subtle detail in the Tokyo street scene is the manholes in the asphalt.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makashiwakui_header-copy.png\" alt=\"makashiwakui_header-copy\" width=\"716\" height=\"206\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5832 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I have no idea how these manholes look, but I googled \"Tokyo manholes\" and I got some ideas:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Deer-on-Japanese-Manhole-Cover-No-Color-By-jpellgen-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Deer-on-Japanese-Manhole-Cover-No-Color-By-jpellgen\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5833 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7548edit-1024x696.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7548edit\" width=\"640\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5834 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I edited it a bit in Photoshop to can find the depth profile:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2manholedeer.png\" alt=\"2manholedeer\" width=\"630\" height=\"631\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5836 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2manhole.png\" alt=\"2manhole\" width=\"953\" height=\"944\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5835 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I exported this as an alpha PNG with the plan of using it to give it depth but somehow the natural textures already had this depth. I did have to tweak the color of the texture until it fit the scene.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-29-20.25.37-1024x871.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-29 20.25.37\" width=\"640\" height=\"544\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5816 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This was hard because whatever I did the color didn't go into the texture. So I actually used the inverted color of blue (orange) and set that to SUBSTRACT as a blending mode from the texture. That worked and gave it the right dark blue tone.</p> <p>And then we got this:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-manhole4.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-manhole4\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5819 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-manhole3.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-manhole3\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5820 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-manhole2.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-manhole2\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5821 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-manhole.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-manhole\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5822 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I'm pretty stunned how realistic it looks. It shows that sometimes you don't need to model something but a high res texture (with depth itself) is good enough.</p> <h2>Small details</h2> <p>I had to make the Sapporo sign from the photo:</p> <p><img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"sapporo\" width=\"38\" height=\"51\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5845 sl_lazyimg\"></p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sapporo.png\" alt=\"sapporo\" width=\"38\" height=\"51\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5845\"> <p>Into high-res, by manually recreating it with some reference from Google. I rebuild the logo and the text.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sapporo-hd-716x1024.png\" alt=\"sapporo-hd\" width=\"640\" height=\"915\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5846 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It's not exactly the same, but I couldn't find the exact same text. Here's how it looks in the scene with an attachment to the wall:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-sapporohook.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-sapporohook\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5844 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I also discovered that the wooden sign in front actually has black metal poles:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makashiwakui_header-copy.png\" alt=\"makashiwakui_header-copy\" width=\"716\" height=\"206\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5832 responsively-lazy\"> <p>...so I added those:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-black-metal-poles.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-black metal poles\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5852 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>More aircon units</h2> <p>I only spotted one aircon unit in the original photo:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-29-21.55.43.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-29 21.55.43\" width=\"950\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5848 responsively-lazy\"> <p>....but while watching <a href=\"/learning-3d-day-4/\">Shoin Wolfe's videos from the street</a> I discovered loads more on the ground:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-29-21.54.08-1024x571.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-29 21.54.08\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5850 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-29-21.54.27-1024x575.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-29 21.54.27\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5849 responsively-lazy\"> <p>There's actually loads. So I duplicated my aircon:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-aircons.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-aircons\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5847 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-aircons-around.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-aircons around\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5851 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Here's the whole scene now:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-02-29-render1.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-29-render1\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5853 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Every day, I'm getting closer and closer. I'm nearing the end of the street as well as the end of the month.</p> <p>Next will be <a href=\"/learning-3d-day-29\">adding the doors to the shop fronts</a>, adding some more details in front of the shops on the right. And finally, I'll somehow have to model the guy who is standing in the end of the street in the photo. No idea how I'll do that, but I'm excited!</p>  <p>P.S.
