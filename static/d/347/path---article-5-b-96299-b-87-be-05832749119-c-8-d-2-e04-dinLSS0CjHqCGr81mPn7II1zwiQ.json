There is such a positive energy about the town and that&#8217;s what I love about it most.</p><p class=\"p1\">Saint Tropez has numerous fine hotels, villas and restaurants to keep the most discerning traveller happy. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5-star hotel is the best in St. Tropez</i></b><b><i>?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">For me the Pan Dei Palace is the best 5* Hotel in Saint Tropez. Hotel Byblos is more well known, but I prefer the Pan Dei&#8217;s understated class over the more in your face Byblos.

The satay prawns are to die for and you can chill with a nice glass of Domaine Ott Rose taking in the views and listening to some chilled house music.</p><p class=\"p1\">After lunch, you can pick up the pace a little and head to <a href=\"http://www.nikkibeach.com/destinations/beach-clubs/st-tropez\">Nikki Beach</a> where the party really gets going&#8230;</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20958\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BB-st-Tropez-10.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Saint Tropez\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in </i></b><b><i>[insert city] </i></b><b><i>and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">My favourite fine dining experience in Saint Tropez can be found at <a href=\"http://www.escale-st-tropez.com\">L&#8217;Escale</a>, located in the Port of Saint Tropez.</p><p class=\"p1\">L&#8217;Escale is the perfect place to sit down and watch the super yachts roll in whilst you tuck into a Plats De Fruits De Mer, followed by grilled Fillet de Saint-Pierre (John Dorey) and wash it all down with a glass or 3 of Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20955\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BB-st-Tropez-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C614&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Saint Tropez\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">You will struggle to find a bad meal in Saint Tropez and most of the restaurants serve up a mean Creme Br&#251;l&#233;e or Moelleux au Chocolat, but I would recommend those with a sweet tooth head to a <a href=\"https://www.latartetropezienne.fr/\">Tarte Tropizienne</a> patisserie for a cake of the same name. The cream filled brioche will leave you in a sugar filled trance of ecstasy. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots in </i></b><b><i>Saint Tropez</i></b><b><i>; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?&#160;</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Where do I start? Chanel, Cavalli, Gucci, Hermes, Villbrequin, Breitling&#8230;you won&#8217;t have a problem finding luxury designers in Saint Tropez, the issue may be the balance on your Amex at the end of it!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in St. Tropez</i></b><b><i>?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The Pan Dei has its own onsite wellness centre, and guests can enjoy a massage in their room, onsite or best of all on the Pan Dei&#8217;s very own 100-foot yacht in Saint Tropez port. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">I always enjoy a sunset cocktail at the <a href=\"http://www.senequier.com\">Senequier</a> in Saint Tropez port as I settle down for a good old spot of people watching in the circus that is Saint Tropez marina at sundown.</p><p class=\"p1\">For those looking for a romantic spot, Grimaud village has stunning views across Saint Tropez bay.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20954\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BB-st-Tropez-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Saint Tropez\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We always head to <a href=\"http://www.white1921.com/st-tropez/en\">White 1921</a> champagne cocktail bar to get our pre-dinner game on. They serve up a pretty mean (and large!) champagne Mojito, guaranteed to get you in the mood and as good as any we had in Buenos Aires recently. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you end the night at a fancy club in </i></b><b><i>St. Tropez</i></b><b><i>, which one do you head towards? </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Many would say <a href=\"http://www.lescavesduroy.com\">Caves du Roy</a> in the Byblos hotel, but I would avoid that trap. The club is hard to get into and seriously expensive once you do get in.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VipRoomStTropez/\">The VIP rooms</a> are another option where, if you are lucky, you may get to see a performance by Snoop Dog or Carl Cox.</p><p class=\"p1\">The easier and arguably more fun option is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/papagayo.saint.tropez\">Papagayo</a>, located in the marina, where I have partied many a time until 3am with my wife Gemma and several grey goose, soda, limes!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20956\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BB-st-Tropez-8.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Saint Tropez\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Rob is passionate about food and travel, and recently returned from a 3 month sabbatical to Europe and South America.
