I had the pleasure in accompanying food enthusiast, Natalie Scarr, around Chiang Mai to cook and eat khao soi, a Northern Thai yellow curry noodle dish. Here&#8217;s a look into what went into the making of the Eat Asia in Chiang Mai episodes and my first experience in the film industry.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t have been more thrilled to be asked to work with the iTravel Channel as they filmed their Eat Asia episodes featuring khao soi in Chiang Mai. Anything that involves food, especially Thai food, count me in!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10476\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/JOE_8420-small.jpg?resize=563%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Break from the shoot\" width=\"563\" height=\"393\"></p>\n<p>Eat Asia is a new travel series featuring an up-close look at various Asian cuisines. The nine episode series features three special dishes that are each popular or well-known for in three different cities in Thailand.</p>\n<p>So why was I in the film? I, along with a few others, showed Natalie the ins and outs of this popular Northern Thai dish. Khao soi is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and I had caught the iTravel Channel&#8217;s eye with the <a title=\"Khao Soi &#8211; Northern Thai Curry Noodles | &#3586;&#3657;&#3634;&#3623;&#3595;&#3629;&#3618;\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/khao-soi-northern-yellow-curry-noodles/\">short review</a> I&#8217;d written on the dish awhile back.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10474 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/JOE_8479-small.jpg?resize=563%2C375&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Eat Asia in Chiang Mai's market\" width=\"563\" height=\"375\"></p>\n<p>We had a great time filming over two days. In the first episode, The Origins of Khao Soi <a title=\"Episode 4 Chiang Mai the Origins\" href=\"http://theitravelchannel.tv/episode-4-chiang-mai-the-origins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Watch it here!)</a>,&#160;we went to the market with a chef from a luxury resort. She taught us about the ingredients that go into makings of the dish.</p>\n<p>Whether khao soi is cooked at a quaint establishment or a luxury resort, the ingredients of the addicting yellow coconut curry broth and the egg noodles come straight from the local markets.</p>\n<p>Natalie was amazing to work with, both on and off the screen. She is the perfect host for Eat Asia &#8211; energetic, enthusiastic, and charming. I&#8217;m flattered to have been asked to be a part of this series. Be sure to stay tuned for the next two Chiang Mai episodes due out on&#160;September 4th and September 11th at 8:00pm Bangkok time. &#160;We can&#8217;t wait to see what the future hold for the <a title=\"Eat Asia \" href=\"http://theitravelchannel.tv/category/shows/eat-asia/\" target=\"_blank\">Eat Asia series</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10473\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/JOE_8275-small.jpg?resize=563%2C375&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Eat Asia in Chiang Mai Team\" width=\"563\" height=\"375\"></p>\n \n<p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">You May Also Like</h3>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"iTravel Channelâ€™s Eat Asia in Chiang Mai"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95efa187be058327490119"}}
