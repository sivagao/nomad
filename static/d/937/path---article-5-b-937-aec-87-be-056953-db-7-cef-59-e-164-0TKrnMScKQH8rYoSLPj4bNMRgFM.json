Upwork has a ton of jobs posted every few minutes. In fact, whenever I&#8217;m job searching here, I find new jobs posted every 30&#8211;60 seconds depending on which category I&#8217;m looking at. What does this mean?</p><p name=\"7e99\" id=\"7e99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could spend eternity here applying to jobs.</p><p name=\"4f78\" id=\"4f78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However.</p><p name=\"1cfa\" id=\"1cfa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The only problem is you can apply to just 30 jobs per month. They have this special system with units called &#8220;connects&#8221; that you spend when applying to jobs. Each application costs you two &#8220;connects.&#8221; Every month they replenish.</p><p name=\"e494\" id=\"e494\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So we have a ton of postings, but a limited number of applications&#8230;</p><p name=\"61ad\" id=\"61ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To tell you honestly this is a good thing. There&#8217;s a ton of jobs posted on the site, but the number of bad ones FAR outweigh the good. Finding a good one that pays well is like finding a needle in the haystack, but if you surf the job postings diligently for a few minutes you&#8217;ll find them.</p><p name=\"866c\" id=\"866c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To me, Upwork is the best freelancing platform on the internet. It&#8217;s safe and secure to get paid, easy to get reviewed (which boosts your credibility), and simple enough to apply to great jobs.</p><p name=\"1b68\" id=\"1b68\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You may have to work your way up and accept lower-paying jobs just to get a few good reviews, however once you have three or four jobs under your belt, you should have no problem landing the big projects.</p><h3 name=\"6142\" id=\"6142\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Upwork&#8217;s Payment Structure</h3><p name=\"0f03\" id=\"0f03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">My only major quarrel with Upwork is the payment structure. Last year Upwork had a soft announcement regarding their payment terms. For the first $500 earned with one client, Upwork takes out 20%, which kind of sucks. However, for the next $10,000 after that they take out 10%,<br>and every dollar after $10,000 they take 5%.</p><p name=\"7b8a\" id=\"7b8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The whole thing is a money grab if you ask me, however landing a job here does allow for a mobile lifestyle.</p><p name=\"3f27\" id=\"3f27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The good news is there are other ways to make money remotely. Here are a few more of them.</p><h3 name=\"7094\" id=\"7094\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Indeed</h3><p name=\"9964\" id=\"9964\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I&#8217;m all about diversifying your income. If you have money coming from multiple directions, you&#8217;re not screwed when one contract falls through.</p><p name=\"b9ad\" id=\"b9ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Where Upwork fails with less-than-stellar job postings, Indeed triumphantly shines through. The jobs on Indeed are legit, and pay pretty damn well. It&#8217;s also super easy to apply to stuff.</p><p name=\"c8ee\" id=\"c8ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The method I use with Indeed is to slip &#8220;remote&#8221; in front of the jobs I want. I currently search for two different keywords, and check them once per day:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"1ebc\" id=\"1ebc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Remote Writer</li><li name=\"099c\" id=\"099c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Freelance Writer</li></ul><p name=\"68a5\" id=\"68a5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">That&#8217;s literally it. There&#8217;s at least ten new jobs posted in each of those keyword searches every day, and I think the same can happen to you. If you slip &#8220;remote&#8221; before the job position you&#8217;re searching for, you should find something.</p><p name=\"f72d\" id=\"f72d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One more thing. Make it easy on yourself and fill out your own resume on Indeed. You can one click apply to certain jobs, and you&#8217;ll swiftly thank yourself later.</p><h3 name=\"30a2\" id=\"30a2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Teaching English&#160;Abroad</h3><p name=\"0e70\" id=\"0e70\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">If working on your computer isn&#8217;t your thing, then maybe you&#8217;d enjoy teaching English in other countries! On Teach Away you can find teaching jobs in Asia, South America, and Europe. The only requirements are a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree. There&#8217;s one job I saw that paid $2,000 per month,<br>which is more than enough cash to live well in Southeast Asia.</p><p name=\"abfb\" id=\"abfb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That might be something fun to look into.</p><h3 name=\"578f\" id=\"578f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Trade Work For A Place To&#160;Stay</h3><p name=\"e8c0\" id=\"e8c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This doesn&#8217;t exactly count as being a &#8220;digital nomad,&#8221; but you could use Worldpackers to exchange work for a place to live. Most places only require 20&#8211;24 hours of work per week, and you mostly get to stay in hostels to meet other interesting world travelers such as yourself!</p><p name=\"a98e\" id=\"a98e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Cool, right?</p><p name=\"f7f1\" id=\"f7f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Hey, if anything, you could check into one of these spots and freelance during your off hours for extra cash. At least you have free housing!</p><h3 name=\"6d62\" id=\"6d62\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Throwing Spaghetti At The&#160;Wall</h3><p name=\"93b0\" id=\"93b0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">You thought there was a job throwing spaghetti at the wall?
