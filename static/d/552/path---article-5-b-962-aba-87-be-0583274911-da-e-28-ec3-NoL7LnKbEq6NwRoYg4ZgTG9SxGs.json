It is not because I am any less intelligent than my colleagues; however, I have realized that I achieve true bliss from living in exotic cultures around the globe. It is for this reason that I have traveled to fifty-seven countries and am currently living in my ninth country. </p><p class=\"p1\">From personal experience, I can truly say that it takes a specific type of person to be able to put their life into a suitcase, photocopy some emergency documents, and ultimately, go for it! </p><p class=\"p1\">If you are considering becoming a nomad, it is important that you have the innate ability to make friendships wherever you go and that you take every opportunity to learn about a new culture when you are on the road. It is through this mindset that you will truly find fulfillment as you see the world. Additionally, if you are considering this kind of lifestyle, it is important that you do have some form of skill that will be able to be transferred into a profit when you are abroad. </p><p class=\"p1\">Due to <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/14-ways-earn-abroad-make-money-travel/\">the plethora of online opportunities</a> that are available for making a reliable living, it is absolutely possible to become a digital nomad should you have the opportunity to consult online nomad guides for pertinent tips and tricks. </p><h3 class=\"p1\"><p class=\"s1\"><b>Which Jobs Actually Can Be Done Online</b></p></h3><p class=\"p1\">It is always amusing to encounter the skeptical individual who is not convinced that one can make a reliable income online; however, it is important to know which potential industries lend themselves more to the possibility of making a substantial amount of income online before deciding to declare yourself a digital nomad. </p><p class=\"p1\">One of the most prominent industries to make a living online is to be an online seller on a site such as eBay because drop shipping is a possibility rather than having a physical address.
