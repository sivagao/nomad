Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to Jakarta</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in Jakarta.</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Hi!&#160; I&#8217;m Justine, a backpacker turned expat.&#160; I actually just moved to Phnom Penh where I work as a freelance writer.&#160; But before I moved to Cambodia I had the opportunity to live in Jakarta, Indonesia, for a full year.&#160; A lot of people don&#8217;t really know this but Jakarta is a great city for indulging in all things luxury.&#160; From 5-star hotels to fancy spas to trendy shops, Jakarta seriously has it all.&#160; The sky really is the limit there!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11269\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Me-in-Indonesia.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes </i></b><b><i>Jakarta</i></b><b><i> a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">When most people think of Jakarta the word &#8220;glamorous&#8221; isn&#8217;t the first word to pop into their minds&#8230;at least it wasn&#8217;t for me.&#160; But when I moved there I realized that I had been seriously mistaken.&#160; Hidden beneath the chaotic surface is all the glitz and glamour you could ever want.&#160; It&#8217;s possible to dine at French bistros, book a night in a $15,000 a night presidential suite (no joke!), or drink the night away at an amazing rooftop bar.&#160; Seriously, if you&#8217;ve got the money Jakarta is<i> the</i> place to spend it!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11265\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/HOTEL-view-of-Jakarta-from-Pullman.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"> </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">When I first moved to Jakarta my boyfriend and I were put up in the <b><a href=\"http://www.agoda.com/en-in/pullman-jakarta-central-park-hotel/hotel/jakarta-id.html?cid=1716750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pullman Jakarta Central Park</a></b>, a super swank 5-star hotel located in the heart of the city.&#160; Our room had floor-to-ceiling windows, and the views of the city were pretty incredible.&#160; What I liked about the Pullman was that it was really modern and full of funky art, and it pretty much had the best international buffet restaurant <i>ever</i>, offering everything from sushi to traditional Indonesian foods to ultra-fancy desserts.&#160; But this city is loaded with really nice hotels, the <b><a href=\"http://www.agoda.com/en-in/mulia-hotel/hotel/jakarta-id.html?cid=1716750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hotel Mulia Senayan</a></b> and <b><a href=\"http://www.agoda.com/hotel-indonesia-kempinski-jakarta/hotel/jakarta-id.html?cid=1716750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hotel Indonesia Kempinski</a></b> are where a lot of VIPs and celebrities stay (rooms go for around $250+ a night).&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The <b><a href=\"http://www.agoda.com/en-in/artotel-jakarta-thamrin/hotel/jakarta-id.html?cid=1716750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARTOTEL</a></b> is mid-range boutique hotel that I&#8217;m obsessed with.&#160; I never got the chance to stay there but I did frequent its great rooftop bar, <b>BART</b>.&#160; (FYI, they make a killer old fashioned!)&#160; What I love about the ARTOTEL is that it&#8217;s one of the few quality boutique hotels in the Jakarta.&#160; Every room is unique and the walls are decorated by some of the city&#8217;s most renowned street artists.&#160; It&#8217;s really nice, really affordable and it offers something truly unique &#8211; a quality I always appreciate in hotels. (Rooms start at around $65)</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11260\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BOUTIQUE-HOTEL-ARTOTEL.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The first thing that pops into my mind is either taking a day trip to the botanical gardens of nearby Bogor or visiting neighboring Bandung to check out the otherworldly crater lake, <b>Kawah Putih</b>.&#160; But for anyone who&#8217;s looking for a bit of adventure within the city center, I wrote a whole guide all about the <a href=\"http://travel-lush.com/9-things-to-do-jakarta/\">fun and weird things to do in Jakarta</a>.&#160; There are tons of options for anyone who&#8217;s looking for a little adventure!&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Jakarta is a city of malls.&#160; And most of them are really, <i>really</i> high end.&#160; Two of the most famous malls are <b>Plaza Indonesia</b> and <b>Grand Indonesia</b>.&#160; They are filled with every designer store imaginable.&#160; And they are so big they can keep you entertained for an entire day.&#160; Jakarta is pretty much a shopper&#8217;s paradise.&#160; Or, if you&#8217;re just looking for a place to hang out, the malls are home to some of the city&#8217;s best restaurants.&#160; Another great place to hang out is <b>Pantai Indah Kapuk (PIK)</b>, a beachside area that has tons of great cafes and restaurants.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Jakarta and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">This is tough because Jakarta is full of really, really great restaurants, so I&#8217;ll just name a couple!&#160; <a href=\"http://www.namaazdining.com/\">Namaaz</a> is a molecular gastronomy restaurant and it&#8217;s all the rage in Jakarta right now.&#160; It&#8217;s so exclusive it can only accommodate 28 people per night.&#160; They serve a 17-course meal, which is constantly changing depending on the season.&#160; It&#8217;s progressive Indonesian food, so they serve up dishes like <i>sate klopo</i> (satay with charcoal-smoke infused cassava), <i>wedang jahe</i> (a sweet ginger soup) and nitrogen ice cream.&#160; <a href=\"http://www.pttgarage.com/\">Potato Head Garage</a> is another Jakarta favorite.&#160; It&#8217;s sort of like a modern twist on a steakhouse.&#160; Their menu has things like Asian Beef Tartare, spiced with galangal and kaffir lime, and is famous for all things beef.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11261\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DESSERT-photo.jpg?resize=560%2C372&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"372\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Indonesians love desserts so there is no shortage of great dessert spots in the city.&#160; Probably the best place to get cr&#232;me brulee is at <b>Labruletory </b>(located in <a href=\"http://travel-lush.com/things-to-do-jakarta-pasar-santa/\">a funky &#8220;anti-mall&#8221; called Pasar Santa</a>).&#160; It almost looks more like a science project than a dessert but it is fantastic &#8211; they even have a green tea version!&#160; My favorite place for cupcakes is <b>Twelve Cupcakes</b>.&#160; It&#8217;s actually a Singaporean company but there are shops sprinkled around Jakarta.&#160; The red velvet and peanut butter chocolate are to die for!&#160; The Nutella <i>martabak</i> (like a thick pancake) from <b>Martabak Boss</b> is probably my favorite dessert in the city! </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?&#160;</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Anyone who knowns me knows that I&#8217;m not the most fashion-savvy person.&#160; But because I worked as a lifestyle writer for <i>The Jakarta Post</i>, it allowed me to meet some up-and-coming Jakarta-based designers.&#160; One of my favorite young designers is named <b>Martha Ellen</b>.&#160; As a traveler I&#8217;m always fond of designers who incorporate traditional elements into their work.&#160; She is a British-native based out of Jakarta and uses a traditional Indonesian fabric called <i>ikat</i> to create colorful and cute dresses, skirts, tops&#8230;you name it.&#160; <b>The Goods Dept</b> is also <i>the</i> place to find all of Indonesia&#8217;s trendy local designers. </p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11262\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FASHION-picture.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11263\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FASHION-sketches.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Jakarta?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Jakarta has so many salons, it honestly isn&#8217;t even possible to walk a block without running into one.&#160; But when it comes to massages, <b>Kneads to Know</b> is a great new place.&#160; <b>SPA Intercontinental</b> is an excellent place to splurge on a rubdown.&#160; They are famous for their red wine wrap! </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s easy.&#160; Anyone who&#8217;s visiting Jakarta needs to visit <b>Skye Bar</b> at least once.&#160; It&#8217;s a great place to grab a drink and because it&#8217;s on the 59th floor it easily has the best view in the city. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><b>BART</b> (located in the ARTOTEL) was my go-to spot to get a drink, mainly because it had a good vibe, great music and I just have a thing for rooftop bars!&#160; <b>The Safehouse</b> is also a fun place to go for a cocktail.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11267\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Iconic-monument-in-Jakarta.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you end the night at a fancy club, which one do you head towards? </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Jakarta is famous for its nightclubs.&#160; There are honestly tons to choose from.&#160; <b>Immigrants</b> is great because it has a killer view of the city, and I hear great things about <b>Dragonfly</b> and <b>Colosseum </b>too.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11264 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Gravatar-Pic.jpg?resize=111%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to jakarta\" width=\"111\" height=\"150\">Justine Lopez is a California girl who always seems to take the unconventional route in life.&#160; She also suffers from a serious case of wanderlust.&#160; In 2013, she set out on a yearlong journey that took her from Southeast Asia to South America.&#160; After a crazy turn of events she&#8217;s now living and working as a freelance writer in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.&#160; As she meanders her way through her backyard of Southeast Asia she&#8217;s always seeking out great food, budget travel deals and amazing new travel destinations.&#160; Follow Justine on her blog <a href=\"http://travel-lush.com\">Travel Lush</a> and <a href=\"http://facebook.com/thetravellush\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://instagram.com/thetravellush\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/thetravellush\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118434130039367352400/posts\">Google+</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.bloglovin.com/blogs/travel-lush-12462497\">Bloglovin&#8217;</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#160;</p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"><h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">Related</h3></p><img width=\"594\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/EmailSidebar-01.png?fit=594%2C485&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" et_bloom_image_no_animation et_bloom_image\" alt=\"\"><p>Join my email list and get exclusive updates &amp; news straight to your inbox.&#160;</p><p>I will never give away, trade or sell your email address.
