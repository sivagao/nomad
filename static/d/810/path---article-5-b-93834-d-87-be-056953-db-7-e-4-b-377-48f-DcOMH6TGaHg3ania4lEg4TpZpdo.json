Believe it or not, employees are opting for 30 more minutes of shut eye over 30 minutes in traffic. Turns out they prefer home cooked meals at a kitchen table over microwaved frozen meals in the breakroom. They&#8217;re also choosing impactful co-worker collaboration over water cooler gossip. In short, remote work is working.</p><p name=\"66fd\" id=\"66fd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">According to a 2015 Gallup poll, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-climbs.aspx?g_source=remote%20work&amp;g_medium=search&amp;g_campaign=tiles\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">37% of the US labor force</a> works remotely, and that number is only rising. Yet, misconceptions and stigmas persist about remote work&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;things like work attire (Do remote workers even get dressed?) and level of commitment (If they can&#8217;t be bothered to get to an office, they can&#8217;t possibly care that much).</p><p name=\"fbbf\" id=\"fbbf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s time to put stereotypes to rest. For the naysayers of remote work, here are 10 debunked myths about this growing sector.</p><h3 name=\"caf7\" id=\"caf7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 1: Remote Work Means Productivity Decreases</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*W8WMsypWMhAZOUDb.png\"><p name=\"d0e4\" id=\"d0e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It&#8217;s easy to assume that someone who works remotely is more distracted because they don&#8217;t have a boss within earshot to keep tabs on them. But,<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study by</a> the Harvard Business Review proves the contrary, noting some companies saw worker productivity increase by 13.5% after permitting remote work.</p><p name=\"e9cf\" id=\"e9cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Someone working outside of the office has fewer distractions to contend with, like the common <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYHcQ5T8Cjk\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">breakroom effect&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;</a>the idea that workers are being pulled away from their desks to chat over coffee or share a piece of cake for a colleague&#8217;s birthday. Remote workers avoid these interruptions and the<a href=\"http://brainsonfire.com/2015/05/14/i-swear-im-wearing-pants-misconceptions-about-remote-employment/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> time needed to refocus</a> after the interruption.</p><h3 name=\"c6d9\" id=\"c6d9\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 2: Remote Workers Are Out Of&#160;Contact</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*opA1h5HN7DH13Ioh.png\"><p name=\"9864\" id=\"9864\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Just because remote workers are not in an office doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re off having a picnic somewhere. Their work is likely tied to a business that operates during regular business hours with a team clocking in a fairly standard eight hour work day. According to <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7256-remote-work-myths.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maren Donovan, CEO of Zirtual</a>, &#8220;Business thrives upon other people&#8217;s deadlines and needs.&#8221;</p><p name=\"5346\" id=\"5346\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/TINYpulse_What_Leaders_Need_to_Know_About_Remote_Workers.pdf?t=1462203875281\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> conducted by TINYpulse on the satisfaction and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/05/02/are-remote-workers-happier-and-more-productive-new-survey-offers-answers/#2dc6bd25455c\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">productivity</a>of remote workers, a whopping 52% reported having contact with their manager at least once daily, with an additional 34% reporting once a week interactions with managers.</p><p name=\"b095\" id=\"b095\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, it&#8217;s unlikely that a remote worker can take three hours in the middle of the day for a spa appointment without repercussion.</p><h3 name=\"a11a\" id=\"a11a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 3: Remote Work Means Your Businesses Data Is&#160;Unsafe</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*fuObw4aH96rtUbEq.png\"><p name=\"fc64\" id=\"fc64\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Many worry that transferring company information and data to computers on unsecured servers will lead to breaches in confidentiality. This is simply not true. Technology has advanced as such that a qualified IT team can keep these types of issues to a minimum.</p><p name=\"c937\" id=\"c937\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are a wealth of safe solutions being leveraged by IT teams everywhere. Setting employees up with cloud-based applications means the security is outsourced to vetted software programs, and IT teams can monitor version control without needing access to an employee&#8217;s physical machine. In addition, good security practices like setting up <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two factor authentication</a> and virtual private networks (<a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2030763/how-and-why-to-set-up-a-vpn-today.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VPN</a>) ensures that information is locked down and unable to be breached by unauthorized people.</p><p name=\"b437\" id=\"b437\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As many would argue, someone who intends to steal information will do so regardless of their work location. This, like many issues with remote work, are people problems, not location problems.</p><h3 name=\"1fb1\" id=\"1fb1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 4: Communication Suffers</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*cYl-C5uFrEMIyN1f.png\"><p name=\"3e3f\" id=\"3e3f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When someone works remotely it does not mean the <a href=\"http://blog.trello.com/when-to-slack-and-when-to-hold-back-tips-for-better-team-communication/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quality of communication</a> goes down. Telecommunication removes in-person nuances and helps employees to dive right into the meaningful work. Yet, for this to work, managers need to outline <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/jobcenter/workplace/bruzzese/2011-02-23-tips-for-remote-workers_N.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clear expectations and tools for communication</a> should someone choose to work remotely.</p><p name=\"56c9\" id=\"56c9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There&#8217;s also a growing trend of remote companies going to great lengths to provide digital methods of socialization. Setting aside intentional<a href=\"http://blog.trello.com/how-15-minutes-each-week-keeps-our-distributed-team-connected/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocks of time for casual</a> &#8220;breakroom talk&#8221; via video calls, non-work related Slack channels (pets, kids, and sports channels are always a hit), and <a href=\"http://blog.trello.com/how-we-support-remote-culture-and-come-together-with-trello/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offsite meetups</a> are all ways that remote teams foster communication and feel connected.</p><h3 name=\"647e\" id=\"647e\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 5: Meetings Are Ineffective</h3><p name=\"cb2c\" id=\"cb2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Like other forms of communication, meetings actually become more effective when conducted via Skype, <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>, or other tech.</p><p name=\"0d88\" id=\"0d88\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When the people needed to accomplish a project work in the same space daily, there&#8217;s a feeling that the attention of the team and ability to work on this one initiative are unlimited. Remote teams, however, are <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7256-remote-work-myths.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more conscious</a> of different time zones and workloads when there&#8217;s a specific time allotted for a particular project.</p><h3 name=\"89d8\" id=\"89d8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 6: Remote Workers Are&#160;Lonely</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*baC3l8c6uArnbv6U.png\"><p name=\"25b7\" id=\"25b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Working remotely does not mean being holed up in a silo all day. It&#8217;s true that someone who works remotely may choose to work alone in their home on occasion. But that&#8217;s not their only option. Coffee shops, libraries, and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-schneider/the-rise-of-coworking_b_8382042.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coworking spaces</a> are exceedingly popular among these &#8220;office-less&#8221; workers.</p><p name=\"439b\" id=\"439b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">New sites like <a href=\"https://workfrom.co/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Workfrom</a> are aggregating the feedback of remote workers to curate the best public locations for getting stuff done. There are even startups focused on <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/spacious-wants-to-turn-restaurants-into-coworking-spaces-2016-6\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bringing remote workers</a> into unoccupied spaces, like restaurants, during work hours.</p><p name=\"a37d\" id=\"a37d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The social aspect of work is more deliberate, but certainly not diminished in a remote work setting.</p><h3 name=\"208f\" id=\"208f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 7: Remote Work Increases Costs</h3><p name=\"1e02\" id=\"1e02\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Some people assume that the IT concerns actually increase the cost of employing a remote worker. Overall, this is simply not true. Admittedly there are added initial shipping costs to provide desks and equipment to someone wherever they&#8217;re located. Overall, however, remote workers end up being cheaper.</p><p name=\"d9e9\" id=\"d9e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/solutions/small_business/resource_center/articles/secure_my_business/how_to_cut_overhead/index.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Overhead costs actually decrease</a> because larger office spaces are not needed, reducing money spent on sky-high rent, furniture, maintenance, and in-office amenities such as coffee, food, and copy machines. Not to mention the reduced carbon footprint of the company due to employees&#8217; lack of commutes.</p><h3 name=\"43b7\" id=\"43b7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 8: Company Culture&#160;Suffers</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*DMTQvFYUBSKHHrVc.png\"><p name=\"ec03\" id=\"ec03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It&#8217;s a valid claim that <a href=\"http://worksnug.com/blog/8-misconceptions-about-remote-working-that-could-be-holding-your-business-back\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">office camaraderie is not the same</a> when some of the team works off site. But what makes a company great is not the water cooler gossip&#8211;which can actually make your company culture suffer&#8211;but the way employees are treated and the value they are shown. Simple tweaks to communication strategies ameliorate this issue entirely.</p><p name=\"c4ad\" id=\"c4ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Managers do need to make a conscious effort to show the importance they place on each team member if they&#8217;re not available for a daily stop and chat, but it&#8217;s not seen to ruin positive cultures.</p><h3 name=\"49a7\" id=\"49a7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 9: Remote Workers Are Working&#160;24/7</h3><p name=\"8516\" id=\"8516\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Just because someone does not physically arrive at and leave an office each day does not mean that they never clock out. Remote workers keep similar schedules to their office counterparts and the same expectations of work-life balance should be placed upon them.</p><p name=\"6388\" id=\"6388\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Similarly, for friends of remote workers, just because they work from home&#8211;or away from an office&#8211;does not mean they are the go-to person for an early happy hour drink or last minute airport ride. There&#8217;s still a job to get done.</p><h3 name=\"3217\" id=\"3217\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Myth 10: Netflix Is Streaming All&#160;Day</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*dH2skK_GBH1e06fc.png\"><p name=\"e59a\" id=\"e59a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Remote workers likely enjoy the same <a href=\"http://blog.trello.com/organize-workspace-maximum-productivity/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">background noise</a> as office workers&#8211;be it keeping the radio or Spotify on in the background. However, this group also tends to overcompensate for their lack of facetime by <a href=\"http://communitytable.parade.com/343820/heatherhuhman/5-common-misconceptions-about-working-from-home/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">placing more structure in their days</a>.</p><p name=\"292d\" id=\"292d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote workers report that they do actually put on pants every day and find it just as hard as office workers to focus and remain productive while watching their favorite show.</p><h3 name=\"8943\" id=\"8943\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Are you working remotely?
