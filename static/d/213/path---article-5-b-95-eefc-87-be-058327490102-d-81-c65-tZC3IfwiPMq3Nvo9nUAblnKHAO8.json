Since we&#8217;ve lived in this tiny town in Northern Thailand for the past five years, we&#8217;ve had our fair share of friends, family members, and readers who want to know what to see, what to eat, and where to stay in Chiang Mai. Well, we&#8217;ve finally gotten around to answer the last question!</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: we have a house and don&#8217;t bounce from hotel to hotel like many other travel bloggers do. However, we still keep a running list of the accommodations we&#8217;ve stayed at, friends have told us about, or we&#8217;ve learned through the grapevine and were impressed by what we heard. We pay attention to details like location, atmosphere, the helpfulness of the staff, and the value for money before deciding where the best place to stay are and sharing our finds.</p>\n<p>Below you&#8217;ll find a short but solid list of best resorts, hostels, guesthouses, and hotels in Chiang Mai of all sorts of styles and budgets. We&#8217;ve also included a map (at the bottom of the post) so you can easily see where they are in relation to other parts of the city. Enjoy!</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Where_to_Stay_in_Chiang_Mai_on_a_Budget\">Where to Stay in Chiang Mai on a Budget</p></h2>\n<p>Chiang Mai is extremely budget-friendly and has an incredible selection of hostels and guesthouses that range from as little as 5 USD per night upwards to around 30 USD per night. It&#8217;s a nice change of pace if you&#8217;re coming from the more expensive areas of the country like Bangkok or the islands. In this price range, you can expect to get a small but clean room, a shared lounging area, and usually some complimentary tea and snacks. Here are our top picks for where to stay in Chiang Mai on a budget:</p>\n \n<p><a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=10&amp;cid=1608701&amp;hid=1157556\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pix6.agoda.net/hotelImages/115/1157556/1157556_16010814480038968835.jpg?resize=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\"></a><br>\nHeuan Pak-Dee <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\">[email&#160;protected]</a> is great value for money and its location near one of the most popular temples in the city can&#8217;t get much better. The hostel&#8217;s friendly staff is happy to make recommendations for things to do around the city and they&#8217;ll help to arrange for tours and transportation, too.&#160;Decorated with colorful Thai accents, we really like that it offers both private rooms and co-ed and female only dorms, which is a great option for solo female travelers.</p>\n<p><strong>Nearest major landmark:</strong> Phra Singh Temple<br>\n<strong>Room types: </strong>Twins, King, Dorms (co-ed and female only)<br>\n<strong>Amenities:</strong> Bicycles, breakfast, wifi, garden</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read reviews for Heuan Pak-Dee <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\">[email&#160;protected]</a> on&#160;<a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/heuan-pak-dee-hostel-gallery/hotel/chiang-mai-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/heuan-pak-dee-chiangmai.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Booking.com</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<h3><p id=\"The_Peaberry\">The Peaberry</p></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=10&amp;cid=1608701&amp;hid=247389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/pix6.agoda.net/hotelImages/247/247389/247389_16063010570044279662.jpg?resize=960%2C639&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"639\"></a><br>\nLocated in the upper right-hand corner of the Old City, we love that it&#8217;s easy to reach both the main part of town and the modern Nimman area if you stay at The Peaberry.

We also noticed it was a good choice for families traveling with a small child or two because they have family suites.</p>\n<p><strong>Nearest major landmark:</strong> Chiang Mai RAM Hospital<br>\n<strong>Room types:</strong> Double, Singles, Family Suite<br>\n<strong>Amenities:</strong> Free wifi, free breakfast, free bicycles</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read reviews for The Peaberry on&#160;<a href=\"http://www.agoda.com/the-peaberry-chiangmai-hotel/hotel/chiang-mai-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/the-peaberry.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Booking.com</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<h3><p id=\"Chiang_Maan_Residence\">Chiang Maan Residence</p></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=10&amp;cid=1608701&amp;hid=289990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Where-to-Stay-in-Chiang-Mai-Chiang-Maan-Residence.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"></a><br>\nChiang Maan Residence is a Thai-styled serviced apartment that features cozy gardens and rustic Northern Thai decorations.

You can usually get a complimentary breakfast and airport shuttle and other perks like laundry services or a pool to cool off in.&#160;There are several chain hotels and big brands in town, but (shhh!) but we think the best places are the charming boutique hotels that line the quiet streets in the Old City. These are our recommendations for where to stay in Chiang Mai if you want a balance between price and comfort:</p>\n<h3><p id=\"Moon_Dragon_Hotel\">Moon Dragon Hotel</p></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=10&amp;cid=1608701&amp;hid=1155923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pix6.agoda.net/hotelImages/115/1155923/1155923_17020918020050892687.jpg?resize=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\"></a><br>\nMoon Dragon Hotel is situated right on the Sunday Night Walking Street in the center of the Old City, so it&#8217;s in the middle of the action and in close proximity to many shops and caf&#233;s. Its rooms have ample sunlight and are decorated in a sleek but serene Asian d&#233;cor. We like that after enjoying a day out on town, we could come back and enjoy a cool dip in the room&#8217;s private pool and relax on our room&#8217;s balcony.</p>\n<p><strong>Nearest major landmark:</strong> Thapae Gate<br>\n<strong>Room types:</strong> Twins, King, Suite, Studio<br>\n<strong>Amenities:</strong> Breakfast, wifi, pool</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read reviews for Moon Dragon Hotel on&#160;<a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/moondragon-hotel-chiang-mai/hotel/chiang-mai-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/moon-dragon.html?aid=373848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Booking.com</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<h3><p id=\"Thapae_Loft_Hotel\">Thapae Loft Hotel</p></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/partners/partnersearch.aspx?pcs=10&amp;cid=1608701&amp;hid=675501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/pix6.agoda.net/hotelImages/675/675501/675501_15102316310037124045.jpg?resize=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\"></a><br>\nEver since it was built a couple of years ago, we&#8217;ve been interested in Thapae Loft every time we drive by.

Although the&#160;five-star&#160;standards aren&#8217;t quite high as you&#8217;d find in, say, Europe, it&#8217;s incredible what you can get on that type of money. You can look forward to taking a dip in a beautiful pool, enjoying an incredible breakfast spread, indulging in a spa, and more.
