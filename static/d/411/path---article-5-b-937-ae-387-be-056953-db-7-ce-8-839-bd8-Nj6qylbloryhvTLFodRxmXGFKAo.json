Welcome to a new way of viewing (and visiting) the&#160;world.</h2><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-1ELESHOnB45D3w1tRuh8g.jpeg\"><p name=\"7f7c\" id=\"7f7c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Kate Smith is no ordinary woman.</p><p name=\"b2ea\" id=\"b2ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Two years ago she quit her job and bought a one-way plane ticket to Prague.</p><p name=\"5cf0\" id=\"5cf0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Turns out the Czech Republic was the first stop on an elite program called Remote Year&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;a magical experience where 75 Digital Nomads get together for a year and move to a different city every month. Sound like a dream? Well, it was more than that to Kate. It was a reality.</p><p name=\"5eb0\" id=\"5eb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When pondering her drastic leap into the unknown, she had this to say.</p><blockquote name=\"996b\" id=\"996b\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&#8220;The time is never right.&#8221;</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"a3bf\" id=\"a3bf\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&#8220;You have to make it the right time. For me, I push my boundaries and limits in so many ways. When I started my Nomad journey, it wasn&#8217;t a financially comfortable situation for me to be in, but I did it anyways. Most people would&#8217;ve said &#8216;I&#8217;m gonna save up for six months to a year.&#8217;</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"7a4f\" id=\"7a4f\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">I think that people need to realize it&#8217;s your responsibility to make it happen. Nobody is going to make it happen for&#160;you.&#8221;</strong></blockquote><p name=\"6dc9\" id=\"6dc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Wait a second&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;how did Kate get to this point? What kind of crapshoot was she involved in that led her to denounce corporate life and embrace digital nomad-ism?</p><p name=\"5dc4\" id=\"5dc4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A terrible job? Crappy boss? Bills?</p><p name=\"480e\" id=\"480e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Actually, none of that. She was living the life she always dreamed of.</p><blockquote name=\"b9db\" id=\"b9db\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&#8220;I was living downtown in the city, and working as a Project Manager at an Ad Agency. That&#8217;s when things changed for me. It was everything I wanted but I remember being in the condo that I was renting and thinking: This is everything I&#8217;ve ever wanted, why don&#8217;t I feel happier?</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"128b\" id=\"128b\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">It was at that point that I realized, I was working to live, to work to live. It was a never ending cycle and a cycle that wouldn&#8217;t allow me the opportunity to&#160;travel.&#8221;</strong></blockquote><p name=\"e8b7\" id=\"e8b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If you didn&#8217;t already guess, Kate&#8217;s pretty smart. What&#8217;s really crazy about her journey is how sure she was of her path in college and early adulthood. Unlike many reading, she knew exactly what she wanted to do and had no problem getting it upon graduation.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UjocPZK3T90eQhvdtCT5Yw.jpeg\">Kate Smith<blockquote name=\"f1f5\" id=\"f1f5\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&#8220;When I was in college I really enjoyed it. I was really involved. I was pretty certain I knew what I wanted to do to be honest. I had a lot of friends who didn&#8217;t know what they wanted to do, and landing that job at the Advertising Agency was kind of my dream.&#8221;</strong></blockquote><p name=\"0fee\" id=\"0fee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Then all hell broke loose? Fire and brimstone? Apocalypse-level doom?</p><p name=\"c6b6\" id=\"c6b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No. She worked as a Project Manager for three years and slowly realized this wasn&#8217;t the life she wanted.</p><p name=\"2c13\" id=\"2c13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;m trying to show that Kate&#8217;s story isn&#8217;t ordinary. She got everything she wanted. She did well in college, at her internship, and had no problem landing a job. She worked hard and realized a dream. That&#8217;s definitely something to aspire to for certain people.</p><p name=\"44ad\" id=\"44ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I&#8217;m really saying is there&#8217;s probably a few reading who are about to go through this, or are going through this. They&#8217;re unfulfilled. They got exactly what they wanted, but it&#8217;s not making them happy.</p><p name=\"dd4f\" id=\"dd4f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What do you do then?</p><blockquote name=\"0864\" id=\"0864\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">&#8220;For me I had to re-explore my passions. I was living a corporate lifestyle and I didn&#8217;t know what I actually enjoyed doing anymore. I never had &#8220;free time&#8221;. I would just work, come home, eat dinner, go to sleep and do it all over again.</strong></blockquote><blockquote name=\"078f\" id=\"078f\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">I thought to myself, &#8216;What do I like to do as a person?&#8217; So I signed up for Jiu-Jitsu, Spanish classes&#8230;&#8221;</strong></blockquote><p name=\"9c6c\" id=\"9c6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">To find out how Kate Smith quit her job, found a remote job, and traveled the world for an entire year, download our free </strong><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/c1Kmrj\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Post-Grad Survival Guide Magazine</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> to get the rest of the story.</strong></p></div>","title":"The Digital Nomad Era Is Upon Us – The Post-Grad Survival Guide – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937ae387be056953db7ce8"}}
