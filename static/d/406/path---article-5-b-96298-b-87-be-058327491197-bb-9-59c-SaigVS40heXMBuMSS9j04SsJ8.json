Ben took a little bit of time to get into it, because at first it can feel a bit embarrassing taking weird photos of yourself hanging with painted pandas&#8230; but eventually we started acting like kids and had a laugh.</p><p>It&#8217;s funny that in Asia, to me anyways, it seems people are more apt to take lots of photos. I see more selfie sticks here, more people taking selfies, and so it just seems perfect to have a museum like this. People were having such a laugh!</p><p>This place is actually really impressive, the biggest in Malaysia, and was hand-painted by 23 Korean artists who on average are 60 years old and the last of their generation. There are over 100 pieces of 3D art to play around with. We didn&#8217;t post with all 100 because how is that even possible?! Here are the silly ones we took!</p><p>This is located in Oriental Village and you can spend a whole day here doing the 3D museum, skycab, shopping, and much more I explain over in this post: <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/little-travel-guide-to-langkawi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what to do in Langkawi</a>.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10580\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_153028_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10583\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_153355_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"996\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/langkawi-3d.jpg?resize=560%2C433&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"433\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10577\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_151613_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10581\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_153059_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"996\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10578\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_151818_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C754&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"754\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10573\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/langkawi-3d1.jpg?resize=560%2C433&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"433\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10574\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_150325_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10582\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_153300_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"996\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_151047_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10579\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_152518_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10575\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_20150610_150452_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"langkawi 3d museum\" width=\"560\" height=\"996\"></p><p>&#160;</p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"><h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">Related</h3></p><img width=\"594\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/EmailSidebar-01.png?fit=594%2C485&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" et_bloom_image_no_animation et_bloom_image\" alt=\"\"><p>Join my email list and get exclusive updates &amp; news straight to your inbox.&#160;</p><p>I will never give away, trade or sell your email address.
