This article will help you have a peaceful and entertaining trip. So, here is your itinerary.</p><p><b>Day 1: Overlooking The Hong Kong City &amp; Victoria Harbor</b></p><p>After landing, it&#8217;s best to take some rest, have your lunch and then to witness the Hong Kong Skyline. It is the best way to start your one week Hong Kong itinerary. You will not want to miss the <a href=\"http://etramping.com/hong-kong-view-from-the-top-of-hong-kong-islan/\">breathtaking aerial view of the entire Hong Kong city and the Victoria Harbor</a>. </p><p>You can take a look at this awesome view and enjoy its beauty from Victoria Peak, or The Peak, on Hong Kong Peninsula. It is about 512m or 1811 feet high and offers one of the best scintillating views of the city. You can take a ride up the hill with a series of escalators or by a bus. The entire city is lit up with glittery neon lights at the night which looks amazing. Do not miss the light show (Symphony of Lights) that takes place at 8 pm every day.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18069\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Victoria-Harbor.jpg?resize=560%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Hong Kong Itinerary | a week in Hong Kong\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\"></p><p><b>Day 2: Relaxing In The Nan Lian Garden And Many More</b></p><p>On the second day, you can get the feel of the Hong Kong city in the beautiful Nan Lian Garden.
