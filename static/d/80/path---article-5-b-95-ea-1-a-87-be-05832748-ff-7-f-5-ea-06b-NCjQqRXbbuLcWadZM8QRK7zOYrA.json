However, most hostels on this island aren&#8217;t cheap and cost around 30 EUR per night. You can book your hostel with <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhostels%2FMykonos%2FGreece\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hostelworld</a> </p><p><strong>Budget hotel prices</strong> &#8211; You can find a room at a 2-star hotel for 50 EUR per night. Hotels at this price point include private bathrooms, air-conditioning, and free WiFi. Use <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?region=2813&amp;aid=362916&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Booking.com</a> as they consistently return the cheapest rates. On <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/?irgwc=1&amp;irclid=24aSyeyRVSO91P6T8RRvwxlWUkjXYMUUKzCZSU0&amp;ircid=4273&amp;sharedid=&amp;af=81115044&amp;iratid=9627\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb</a>, shared rooms start at 15 EUR and entire homes (including studio apartments) can be rented for 50 EUR per night. Keep in mind prices shoot up in the summer!</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; While you can find cheap gyros (meat, cheese, sauce, onions, and tomatoes served on pita bread)  and pizza, for the most part, eating out on this island is expensive. The night I went for seafood the going rate was 90 EUR per kilo for fish! Even a light dinner of pasta and wine cost me over 24 EUR! If you want to save money, avoid eating in the main town. Stick to cheap sandwiches, pizza, or gyros. If you cook your meals, expect to pay 50-55 EUR per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; The quickest way to get around is to rent a moped or scooter, which are cheap but they require a license. You can rent a moped for one day for 22 EUR (but as low as 10 EUR per day in the low season). Bus tickets cost about 1.60 EUR (night buses cost 2 EUR). Buses leave every 30-60 minutes, but the frequency depends on the season. A taxi around the island will cost between 9-18 EUR per person, but there are a limited amount and, depending on if it&#8217;s busy, you could be waiting hours.</p></div>","title":"Mykonos Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea1a87be05832748ff7f"}}
