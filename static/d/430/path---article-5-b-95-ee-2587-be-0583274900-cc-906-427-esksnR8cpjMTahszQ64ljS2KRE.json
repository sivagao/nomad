It has amazing beaches &#160;with towering picturesque limestone cliffs that make it&#160;among the world&#8217;s best and biggest rock climbing destinations. And actually,&#160;if you find yourself in Krabi in&#160;mid April, it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity to&#160;watch or even join the Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest.</p>\n<p>Back in April 2014 we had the pleasure of witnessing&#160;the Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest. It&#8217;s&#160;Thailand&#8217;s largest rock climbing competition and&#160;features&#160;lead climbing and deep water soloing. It has some bad ass&#160;freestyle fire shows, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FireRock-Round-Two-10.jpg?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11672\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FireRock-Round-Two-10.jpg?resize=563%2C404&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Spitting Fire at Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest\" width=\"563\" height=\"404\"></a></p>\n<p>Talk about athleticism! These men and women show off their skill and physical prowess during their two-day performances. Sometimes it was all we could do to keep our jaws from dropping in awe.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"When_and_Where\"><p>When and Where</p></p></h2>\n<p>All of the events of the Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest take place in the little town of Railay. It&#8217;s a sub-district of Krabi that&#8217;s only about a 30 minute drive from Krabi&#8217;s airport and another fifteen minute ride by long-tail boat.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11690\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Climbers.jpg?resize=563%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest\" width=\"563\" height=\"540\"></p>\n<p>The competition takes place on every year over the course of&#160;two days in mid April.&#160;The sign-up &amp; sign-in area and main stage is at Phra Nang Cave Beach. There are some pretty hefty cash grand prizes for the winners, too.</p>\n<p>The rock climbing competition is split between the cliffs at Phra Nang Cave Beach and at Tonsai Beach. Both of these&#160;cliff areas are used by climbers year-round.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11673\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RockGirlsCollage.jpg?resize=554%2C412&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Female rock climbers at Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest\" width=\"554\" height=\"412\"></p>\n<p>The deep water soloing takes place in Ao Nang Bay. Here you can arrange for a small boat to take you from Ao Nang Beach out to a barge to watch the competitors. Competitors climb the cliffs that overhang the water and then jump off into deep waters of the Andaman Sea below.</p>\n<p>The freestyle fire competition takes place on Railay West Beach. A large stage is set up along the beach-front restaurants and the competition starts after nightfall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FireRock-Round-Two-4.jpg?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11671\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FireRock-Round-Two-4.jpg?resize=563%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest\" width=\"563\" height=\"373\"></a></p>\n<p>Although we later learned that fire shows occur fairly frequently on Thailand&#8217;s beaches, this was the first show we had ever seen and it was awesome!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11689\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FireCollage2Logo2.jpg?resize=560%2C552&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fire Competitors at Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest\" width=\"560\" height=\"552\"></p>\n<h2><p id=\"Who_Can_Enter_the_Krabi_Rock_and_Fire_International_Contest\"><p>Who Can Enter the Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest</p></p></h2>\n<p>Anyone can sign up, amateurs and professionals alike, and take part in&#160;the Krabi Rock and Fire International Contest.
