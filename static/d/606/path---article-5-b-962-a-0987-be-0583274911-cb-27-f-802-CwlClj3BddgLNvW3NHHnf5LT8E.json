So many yogis feel called to the birthplace of yoga but then overwhelmed when they start looking to book a yoga retreat in India. There are many scams and fake ashrams in India that offer retreats, but the teacher isn&#8217;t actually that great. There are some AMAZING places in India with authentic courses that will teach you about Ayurvedic health, wellness, and different styles of true yoga, which is much <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/the-expert-shares-difference-between-eastern-and-western-yoga/\">different in India</a> than in the West. In India, the focus is not only on the asanas (the physical part like the positions you get into) but also the other half which is breathing, meditation, mantras, and philosophy.</p><p>I&#8217;m not a yogi, although I do take classes here and there, but I have been living in India for five years and have many friends who are very enthusiastic about yoga, are teachers themselves, and go to courses around India. I want to help you find classes by summing up some of the best yoga retreats in India and include some of the most affordable yoga retreats in India.</p><p>For yoga retreats, the website <a href=\"https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/all/d/asia-and-oceania/india?aid=2262\">bookyogaretreats.com</a>&#160;is the most legitimate trustworthy site out there, so that is what I&#8217;ll be linking to throughout this post. They compare reviews from yogis who have stayed at the retreats. You can search yourself on there and use filters based on budget, yoga style, and location. Keep in mind, although India is a relatively cheap place to travel, yoga is not cheap here &#8211; it is priced according to its value, and as the birthplace of yoga, prices are fair.</p><p>There are some other traditional yoga centers like the <a href=\"http://www.ashtangayogamysore.net/\">Ashtanga Institute in Mysore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.biharyoga.net/\">Bihar School of Yoga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artofliving.org/triveni-ashram\">Art of Living</a>, and&#160;<a href=\"http://bksiyengar.com/modules/Institut/RIMYI/rimyi.htm\">Ramamani&#160;Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute</a> in Pune. These are very legit and famous for good reason but are for very serious yoga students. You can read more about traditional places for advanced yoga students <a href=\"https://www.tripsavvy.com/top-india-yoga-centers-1539893\">here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>In this article, I am focusing on places that are for beginners and intermediates, a more relaxing holiday yoga retreat rather than an intense one for very experienced students. I also didn&#8217;t include really expensive ones and tried to choose places that are reasonably priced and/or budget. I think that the advanced yoga students probably know about these famous places mentioned above, so this article is more for people who don&#8217;t know about yoga and want something introductory while they travel India.</p></blockquote><h1>Book a Yoga Retreat in India &#8211; The Top 5 Retreats for Beginners and Intermediate Yoga Students Based on Reviews</h1><h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/swaswara?aid=2262\">Swaswara, Gokarna</a>&#160;126,00 Rs ($1964 USD) for 8 days/ 7 nights</h2><p>This eco-resort is as iconic in India as&#160;<a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/murudeshwar-shiva-statue/\">Gokarna</a>&#8216;s Om beach is. Swaswara is in the state of Karnataka, one of my <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/complete-guide-traveling-karnataka-9-hotspots/\">favorite states in India</a>, which is lesser visited by tourists. This is a higher priced retreat but it&#8217;s pure luxury on the beach. &#8220;Swara&#8221; means inner voice. It&#8217;s for beginners and intermediate yoga students. The lodging is luxury eco, which thatched coconut roofs but modern amenities, including outdoor rain showers with each private hut.</p><ul><li>Daily Ashtanga yoga sessions</li><li>Morning asana practice sessions</li><li>KPJAYI certified teacher and assistant</li><li>Chanting, philosophy, Satsang, and asana technique classes</li><li>Ayurveda consultation and full body treatments</li><li>Twice daily Ayurvedic organic meals</li><li>Limousine group transfers</li><li>7 nights accommodation</li><li>Art classes and Ayurvedic cooking classes are available.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/swaswara?aid=2262\">Click here to read reviews and check availability</a>.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/bodhi-ayurveda-and-yoga-retreat/13-days-one-light-yoga-retreat-in-india?aid=2262\">Hinterland Village Resort, Kochi</a> 38,000 Rs ($591) for 10 nights/ 9 days</h2><p>A budget option. It says &#8220;monsoon&#8221; retreat, but that&#8217;s just because it&#8217;s currently monsoon &#8211; it&#8217;s open all year. The rooms are A/C, surrounded by the jungle and hidden beneath the coconut trees, near paddy fields. The food will be delicious veggie Keralan Ayurvedic food. Here, you&#8217;ll get a consultation with Ayurvedic doctors who are on-site and although this isn&#8217;t some luxurious retreat, it&#8217;s a FANTASTIC value for money.

It has a focus on Astanga Vinyasa yoga, which is a difficult type of yoga (my favorite kind because it feels like you are really exercising). This is for the modern people who want detox juices and WiFi and time to catch the sun by the pool during downtime.

Rishikesh is one of the best places for yoga in India and there are a lot of options there. I personally just showed up and tried out a random ashram I found in Lonely Planet: it was terrible. You&#8217;ll have some classes right on the Ganges, the holiest river in India and maybe the world. This place is popular with backpackers and travelers passing through, so do be sure to book ahead.

It&#8217;s on the beach in Mandrem, which means during down time you&#8217;re near so many amazing things.
