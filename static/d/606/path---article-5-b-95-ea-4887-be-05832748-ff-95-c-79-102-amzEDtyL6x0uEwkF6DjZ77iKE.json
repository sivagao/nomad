There are very few hostels, but there are reasonably priced guest houses and budget hotels. You can book your hostel with <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhostels%2FBahamas\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hostelworld</a> . Expect to pay at least 95 BSD a night for a room in a 2-star budget hotel that sleeps two. This price includes basic hotel amenities like free Wifi, television, and private bathrooms. Use <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?region=13535&amp;aid=362916&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Booking.com</a> as they consistently return the cheapest rates. For the best value, check out <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/?irgwc=1&amp;irclid=24aSyeyRVSO91P6T8RRvwxlWUkjXYMUUKzCZSU0&amp;ircid=4273&amp;sharedid=&amp;af=81115044&amp;iratid=9627\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb</a> where you can rent either a spare room or an entire place from a local. Often times these are located in central neighborhoods or right on the coast at a much better cost per night than a hotel. You can find entire apartments starting around 50 BSD but you&#8217;ll find much more inventory if you look at 90 BSD and up.</p><p><strong>Food</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;ll pay around 8 BSD for fish, a side dish, and dessert, which is fairly reasonable for local fare. However, most restaurants also specialize in American and British meals that can cost between 17-25 BSD a plate. There is often also a compulsory service charge of 15% on your bill, so keep in mind as you settle a check. Expect to pay 60 BSD per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods if you plan on cooking.</p><p><strong>Transportation</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re staying in Freeport or Nassau, a minibus trip for 1.25 BSD is the cheapest way to get around, but they stop running at 6pm. Another option is the wildly popular water-taxi that runs every hour for 6 BSD from Nassau to Paradise Island. In terms of inter-island travel, there are frequent and affordable mail boats going from Nassau to the outer islands that cost about 45 BSD each way, but plan accordingly because these can take anywhere from 12-48 hours and offer little in the way of modern conveniences. Inter-island flights (via Bahamas Air or other local carriers) are a much more efficient option, and if you buy ahead of time, the fare usually won&#8217;t break the bank. Uber, the taxi alternative, is available in Broward and Palm Beach in the Bahamas.</p><p><strong>Activities</strong> &#8211; Snorkeling, diving, swimming with dolphins, and fishing trips can all easily creep up to around 150 BSD each, but are an incredible way to experience the islands if you have the budget. Other inland activities, such as the Pirates of Nassau Museum and the Garden of the Groves on Grand Bahama, are much more reasonable, about 13-15 BSD.</p></div>","title":"Bahamas Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea4887be05832748ff95"}}
