I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest&#160;portrayal&#160;about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here&#160;what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>Writing I did Other than Hippie in Heels:</h2><ul><li>an interview for <a href=\"http://gogirlguides.com/awesome-female-travelers/girls-that-go-an-interview-with-rachel-from-hippie-in-heels/\" target=\"_blank\"><p>Girls That Go</p></a>, one of my favorite sites about female travel</li></ul><h1>This is India (four)</h1><p>I&#8217;ve actually mentioned this in passing when I told you last year how hard it was<a title=\"From a G6 to an Omni\" href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/driving-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">&#160;learning to drive in India</a>, but it&#8217;s story worth telling in full.</p><p>It was early monsoon last year and Ben, Stein our crazy kiwi friend, and Rishab our BFF in Goa, and I were in the good ol&#8217; omni driving home from a quite boozy dinner.&#160; We were about 3 minutes from home.</p><p>Goa is full of speed bumps and as I learned with driving there, you have to slow down a lot before you go over them, as Ben said to me &#8220;always shift to 2nd gear to know you&#8217;re slowing down enough- the car noises will tell you&#8221;. Luckily, that&#8217;s the case because the speed bump we were slowing down for wasn&#8217;t a speed bump.</p><p>It was a python.</p><h3>AN 8-FOOT PYTHON!</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3080.jpg?resize=598%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"omni, india, expat, driving in india, python\" width=\"598\" height=\"800\"></p><p>I am so afraid of snakes, I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how scared I was. There was actually so much pure shock, I couldn&#8217;t even cry. I had only been in Goa about 2 or 3 months at this point and was basically like, &#8220;What the fuck, Ben, you didn&#8217;t tell me there were pythons in our village!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know there were pythons in Goa for that matter.</p><p><strong>I had the exact same reaction when I found a big dead scorpion in the pool.</strong></p><p>Of course, the boys got out and tried to get the snake to play with it (idiots) but it slithered away into the forest.</p><p>Another monsoon has come around and in the last year, we did see a couple more snakes. Some were outside in the wild, some were under our couch, on the walkway, or people&#8217;s pets they&#160;brought out to dinner and let slither on the table while they ate&#8230;</p><p>I have been told that in hot April, May, and early June the snakes come out looking for water. These are the months just before monsoon.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4851\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2014-06-05-at-1.38.24-PM.jpg?resize=560%2C838&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india four\" width=\"560\" height=\"838\"></p><p>Lord Shiva had a pet snake, so most Hindus won&#8217;t kill a snake, so I&#8217;ve been told. They think of them as &#8220;cool&#8221; and some even think it&#8217;s lucky to see pythons. My yoga teacher had a couple fall through cracks in her roof. Friends have told me they&#8217;ve seen larger ones fall from trees near Thalassa or on the Mapusa-Anjuna road stretched out, straight chillin&#8217;!</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post?
