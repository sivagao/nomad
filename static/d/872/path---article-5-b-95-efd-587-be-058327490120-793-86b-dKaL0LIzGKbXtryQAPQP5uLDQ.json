What other city offers such a comfortable standard of living &#8211; delicious local and international food, community happenings and meet-ups, modern conveniences, and an endless array of housing options &#8211; for so little!</p>\n<p>So the big question is: How much does it cost to live in Chiang Mai? Here&#8217;s a look at every last dollar baht we spent over the past year.</p>\n<p><strong>PIN IT FOR LATER!</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"pinit aligncenter wp-image-17916 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cost-of-Living-in-Chiang-Mai-TH-Pinterest.png?resize=400%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fantasizing about living abroad?

We get around town on a motorbike that we bought when we first moved here.</p>\n<p>When we aren&#8217;t doing blog-related tasks, we spend our free time going to the gym, studying Thai, cooking elaborate meals, binge-watching Netflix shows, hanging out with friends, and traveling.</p>\n<p>As far as lifestyles go, we are &#8216;middle of the road&#8217; type of people. Comfort, health, and safety are important to us and we usually choose the option that is the best value for our money.</p>\n<p>Ok, now that THAT picture is painted, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re really looking for:</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Average_Monthly_Cost_of_Living_in_Chiang_Mai\"><p>Average Monthly Cost of Living in Chiang Mai</p></p></h2>\n<p>As with all of our cost of living posts, <strong>we&#8217;re completely transparent about what we spend.</strong> We made sure to include recurring costs as well as one-time or extraordinary expenditures such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p> our annual round-trip flight to the USA</p></li>\n<li><p> Thai visas and the associated upkeep</p></li>\n<li><p>ATM and money transfer fees</p></li>\n<li><p>doctors visits and health insurance</p></li>\n<li><p> blog operation costs</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Currency exchange is 34.8 THB to 1 USD (May 2017) </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Chiang Mai Expenses</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cost in Thai baht</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cost in US dollars</strong></p>\n\n\nRent + Household Items\n&#3647;15,868\n$456\n\n\nGroceries, Eating Out, Drinks\n&#3647;27,196\n$782\n\n\nBills (Utilities + Subscriptions)\n&#3647;5,198\n$149\n\n\nMotorbike, Gas, Taxis\n&#3647;1,964\n$56\n\n\nHealth + Wellness\n&#3647;10,102\n$290\n\n\nExpat Expenses\n&#3647;8,519\n$245\n\n\nTravel + Entertainment\n&#3647;10,537\n$303\n\n\nBlog Maintenance\n&#3647;11,938\n$343\n\n\n<strong>TOTAL SPENDING</strong>\n<strong>&#3647;91,322</strong>\n<strong>$2,624</strong>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p></p><strong><p>Want to see your own cost of living breakdown?

It has everything we could want in a home: Western-style kitchen and bathrooms, comfy (non-wooden) furniture, a washing machine (!), efficient AC units, and a small fenced in yard for our cat.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-17860 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Chiang-Mai-House.jpg?resize=1000%2C646&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Cost of Living in Chiang Mai: 2 BR House for 400 USD\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\"></p>\n<p>Could we pay half as much for a similar house outside of the city? Yes, but it&#8217;s important for us to be within walking distance of the Old City Moat since Angela doesn&#8217;t drive a motorbike.</p>\n<p>As far as household expenses go, we&#8217;ve purchased a few kitchen appliances, organizational units, and an air purifying unit (<a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"Lazada\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/lazada-co-th/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Lazada</a> has been a godsend!). To make our house feel like a home we&#8217;ve bought plants and decorative flowers as well as things to keep our home clean (trash bags, sponges, dish soap, laundry detergent).</p>\n<p>Our cat doesn&#8217;t cost us much.

This category makes up the largest part of our cost of living in Chiang Mai and is nearly double our rent.</p>\n<p>We cook most of our meals at home &#8211; all but maybe four or five meals per week &#8211; so we do a lot of grocery shopping. We buy about half of our groceries at our local open-aired Thai market, a quarter from mini convenience stores, and the other quarter from international grocery stores.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-17920 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Thai-market.jpg?resize=1000%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shopping at Thai markets will keep your cost of living in Chiang Mai, Thailand very low\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\"></p>\n\n\n\n<strong><p>ITEMIZED MARKET ITEMS</p></strong>\n\n\nChicken breast (1 kg or 2.2 lbs)\n&#3647;100\n$2.80\n\n\nExtra large eggs (10)\n&#3647;45\n$1.30\n\n\nPotatoes (1 kg or 2.2 lbs)\n&#3647;40\n$1.15\n\n\nFresh coconut\n&#3647;35\n$1.00\n\n\n\n\n<p>Three or four meals per week we eat out and gravitate toward cuisine-specific restaurants.

Our best meals have always been at places where the customers are almost entirely Thai people.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17845\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cost-of-Living-in-Chiang-Mai-Thai-food.png?resize=1000%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Eating exclusively Thai food will help keep your Chiang Mai cost of living quite low\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\"></p>\n<p>We drink about twice per week. We occasionally drink the local Thai beers (Leo, Chang, Singha) but lately we&#8217;ve been happy drinking simply cocktails, like gin and soda. Every once in a while we&#8217;ll treat ourselves to imported beer or wine.</p>\n<p>We also drink a lot of coffee, both at home and at caf&#233;s. Ever since Chiang Mai&#8217;s coffee culture took off, we&#8217;ve developed a taste for high-quality espresso drinks, which are surprisingly easy to find in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n<strong><p>ITEMIZED DINING OUT &amp; DRINK ITEMS</p></strong>\n\n\nThai meal (2 people)\n&#3647;100\n$3\n\n\nMid-range meal, no alcohol (2 people)\n&#3647;1,270\n$37\n\n\nLeo beer at a bar (660mL large bottle)\n&#3647;100\n$3\n\n\nPint of Guinness\n&#3647;210\n$6\n\n\nJacob&#8217;s Creek Shiraz from a store (750mL bottle)\n&#3647;599\n$17\n\n\nCappuccino from a nice caf&#233;\n&#3647;70\n$2\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"Cost of Living in Chiang Mai, Thailand"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95efd587be058327490120"}}
