As long as you get stuff done, no-one will mind when you&#8217;re in the office. Remote work seemed like a logical next step for self management. We wanted to accommodate each of our 40+ team members&#8217; working styles.</p><p name=\"da0a\" id=\"da0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since my company grew organically, without outside investment, and has less than 10% annual turnover for people who pass probation, I&#8217;m pretty sure we got something right.</p><p name=\"cc60\" id=\"cc60\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote work wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br>&#160;<br>Below are my reflections as a CEO on what we did, why we did it, and what actually happened. As a small development agency, we were able to implemented remote work after a quick discussion&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;basically an experiment after an implied hypothesis of how we thought people wanted to work. What we underestimated was the effort that the entire company would have to make remote work work.</p><h4 name=\"1bdd\" id=\"1bdd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Remote Work&#160;0.1</strong></h4><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yK0bC7max3qeb_qob8HJIA.jpeg\">Image by NASA via&#160;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/launch?photo=n463SoeSiVY\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p name=\"2b50\" id=\"2b50\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The reason we (Roy, Rick, and myself) set up our first office was for us to come back to the office occasionally and hang out. In the end, everyone came everyday so&#8230; it became an actual office.</p><p name=\"079c\" id=\"079c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As fresh graduates at the time, we used going to the office as a motivation to get out of bed. Also, many people in Hong Kong live with family, so there&#8217;s lots of distraction at home. Maybe it&#8217;s a timing thing, as I&#8217;ve read <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-i-work-remotely-hint-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-productivity-34ace30f74fc#.rya9htmzx\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">people with families value the time they spend with their kids</a>.</p><h4 name=\"2042\" id=\"2042\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Remote Work&#160;0.2</strong></h4><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*I1nSBW60H3QhP97Te4R2nw.jpeg\">Image by Francois Hoang via&#160;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@aoirostudio?photo=xxZCfAnMUrM\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p name=\"ce0f\" id=\"ce0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">A more recent case came when we brought a Taipei developer, Johnny, on board. At first, Johnny wanted to work remotely as a change from his previous job in a large company. But after three days at coffee shops, your neck starts to hurt. Three days at home and you feel like a loner.</p><p name=\"f063\" id=\"f063\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After going between home, cafes and co-working spaces, he really wanted to have a proper office. Having stable internet, adjusted monitors, your own keyboard, and a place to leave work behind became more important.</p><p name=\"9337\" id=\"9337\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because Taiwan is culturally close to Hong Kong and has engineering talents, we took the opportunity to setup our first satellite office in Taipei. Johnny is much happier now with colleagues to go for lunch with like we do in Hong Kong.</p><h4 name=\"dbcb\" id=\"dbcb\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">So it didn&#8217;t quite work out after all&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;but&#160;why?</strong></h4><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"adbb\" id=\"adbb\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Work boundaries sometimes break down when you stay at home.</strong> While I am proud of my team&#8217;s work ethic, it leads to burn out (and I am probably the worst example, still).</li><li name=\"3a84\" id=\"3a84\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">People who didn&#8217;t come to the office <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">missed out on things like ad hoc team lunches and dinners</strong>, discussions on the latest tech when a delivery arrives, tastings (wine, whisky, coffee, snacks, and a lot more).</li><li name=\"ecea\" id=\"ecea\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Face-to-face meetings are most efficient </strong>(examples include <a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/blog/remote-work-reddit-yahoo-banned/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit &amp; Yahoo banning remote work</a>).

In addition, remote work doesn&#8217;t allow for quick adaptation or response to ad hoc issues.
