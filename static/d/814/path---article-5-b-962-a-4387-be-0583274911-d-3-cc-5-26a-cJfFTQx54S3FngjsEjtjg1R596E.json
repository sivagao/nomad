Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to Stockholm</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about&#160; yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in Stockholm.</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We are high-school sweethearts that have been on a journey since the start of our marriage to soak up as much life as this world has to offer. We want to inspire others to do the same! Our motto is &#8220;Adventure Travel with a Dash of Class&#8221;. We want to show the world that it&#8217;s possible to travel both adventurously and comfortably. We quickly realized backpacking wasn&#8217;t quite our niche, and we&#8217;re now on a journey to find the perfect balance between adventure and luxury. Stockholm is one of our favorite cities in the world, and it&#8217;s an ideal place to combine style with culture and adventure. We have been twice and would love to go back again!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11407\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden4.jpg?resize=560%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"245\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes&#160;Stockholm&#160;a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Stockholm is one of the most beautiful cities we&#8217;ve ever had the privilege of visiting. Home to some of the best shops in the world, infiltrated with art and culture, and with mouth-watering restaurants on every corner&#8212;Stockholm is one destination you don&#8217;t want to miss out on. The Swedish charm of Stockholm is sure to win you over with its breathtaking views, designer shops, and world&#8217;s best cafe&#8217;s and restaurants.&#160;</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5-star hotel is the best in your town?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://acruisingcouple.com/2014/05/stallmastaregarden-historic-inn-stockholm/\">Stallm&#228;stareg&#229;rden</a> is our choice of stay in Stockholm. This historic inn will have you caught up in its old world charm, without forcing you to sacrifice modern conveniences. Stallm&#228;stareg&#229;rden is Sweden&#8217;s oldest continually running inn that exemplifies Swedish design and architecture without neglecting classic d&#233;cor and contemporary amenities. The Inn overlooks the beautiful Bay of Brunnsviken and is only a quick walk away from the Stockholm city center. </p><p class=\"p1\">We&#8217;re always captivated by the rich history of the Stallm&#228;stareg&#229;rden. This inn dates back to the 1600&#8217;s, and its success can largely be contributed to Queen Kristina, who was so taken by the beauty of the home that she celebrated midsummer there in 1645. Today you will find each of the rooms dedicated to different influential figures of Swedish life and culture. There&#8217;s the Linnaeus Room, after the famous botanist, and the Bellman Room, after the Swedish poet-musician. You&#8217;ll also find original wallpaper, murals, and stoves from the 17th and 18 century.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11410\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden7.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11409\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden6.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We&#8217;d have to stick with the Stallm&#228;stareg&#229;rden again on this one. Really, this hotel is that great. Not only is this hotel luxurious, but it&#8217;s also boutique. It started off as a house in the 1600&#8217;s, and that small elegant feel still echoes throughout the inn today. Not to mention the urban location, with the city center just a walk away! It really is the best of both worlds.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Yes!! There are unending options for those that want to add a little adventure to their luxurious getaway. You could rent a Segway, or bike your way around town. Get a great view of the historical landscape, including runestones from the Viking age, while seeing moose, wild pigs, and deer on a wildlife safari! Not to mention sailing the Archipelago, or going on a Stockholm seal-watching safari. If you really want to have a memorable time get a grand tour of the city from the prime seat of a helicopter! We loved kayaking through the Archipeligo&#8212;and next time we stay for a bit longer, we&#8217;d love to go on one of Stockholm&#8217;s two, three, or five-day kayaking tours. Stockholm also makes a great base for exploring other areas of Sweden. After a week in Stockholm, we ventured north to <a href=\"http://acruisingcouple.com/2014/04/wilderness-adventure-swedish-lapland-part-1/\">explore Lapland </a>via snowshoe, cross-country skiing and dog sled.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11408\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden5.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hangouts during the day?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re a coffee lover, you will definitely find yourself at home in the Swedish culture. The Art of Fika is an indispensable part of the Swedish lifestyle, and easily one of our favorites. Fika literally means to drink coffee and eat snacks, but it&#8217;s so much more than just an afternoon break. It&#8217;s about stopping from all of your busyness to spend quality time with friends or family. For Swedes, pausing to allocate this undisturbed time with others improves their overall well-being, and for this reason, it&#8217;s an irreplaceable and sometimes daily activity. </p><p class=\"p1\">Some choose to fika in their homes, or in restaurants. For all of the best places to fika in Stockholm, check out our article: <a href=\"http://www.travelpulse.com/opinions/blog/the-art-of-fika-in-stockholm-sweden.html\">The Art of Fika</a>. One of our favorites was Sturekatten, a castle-like bakery-cafe, with quite incredible pastries, and even blankets to warm up with during cooler months.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Stockholm and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Reindeer and elk meatballs from Drottninghof, of course! We also loved Smorgastarteriet, whose innovative menu is quite appealing, offering dishes inspired from cities all over Sweden. If you can find it, don&#8217;t miss the chance to try moose burger either&#8212;surprisingly rich and delicious.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11405\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden2.jpg?resize=560%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"276\"> </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We had all of our most delectable deserts in the coffee shops where we experienced fika! My personal favorite: the cinnamon buns. I could not get enough of these enticing sweets! No matter what hand-crafted dessert you choose, you can&#8217;t go wrong with any of these specialties served at our favorite coffee shops: Vete-Katten, Flickorna Helin Voltaire, and Sturekatten.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Acne Norrmalm, the famous jeans brand, boasts five studios in Stockholm. This trendy designer stands by its belief of creating inspiration through showcasing their works of art in studios instead of typical shops. They have their well-known jeans, as well as, a variety of other clothes, jewelry, and shoes.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11404\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden1.jpg?resize=560%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"319\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The Kaknas Television Tower is known for the most spectacular views of Stockholm. Head over there on a clear day and you can see the entire city, and its surroundings. You don&#8217;t want to miss out on views like this.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11406\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/luxury-guide-to-stockholm-sweden3.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to stockholm sweden\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"> </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot.&#160;</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Despite the expensive drinking prices, Stockholm has a thriving nightlife, and you&#8217;ll find plenty of locals going out for a drink. S&#246;dermalm offers a variety of intimate bars and is a great place to get started. Kvarnen is a renowned restaurant and bar that dates back nearly a century; Folkbaren is a simple but classic choice located on Hornsgatan; and Morfar Ginko is a hotspot featuring guest DJs on the weekend, and a great outdoor courtyard open in the warmer months. If you prefer to drink at home, be sure to head to the ABC stores early. Wine isn&#8217;t sold in the supermarkets and the ABC stores close early on Fridays and Saturdays.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11457 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/a-cruising-couple.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"guide to stockholm cruising couple\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></p><p class=\"p1\">Dan and Casey are the two lovebirds, world travelers and adventurers extraordinaire behind the popular travel blog <a href=\"http://acruisingcouple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Cruising Couple</a> &#8211; adventure travel with a dash of class.
