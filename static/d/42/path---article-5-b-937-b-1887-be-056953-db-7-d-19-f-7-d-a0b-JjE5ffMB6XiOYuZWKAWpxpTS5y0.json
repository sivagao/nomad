That Facebook photo of a friend posing on a paradisiacal beach&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;with a laptop and a coconut drink&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and the caption: &#8220;my office for the day.&#8221;</p><p name=\"d9cd\" id=\"d9cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For a lot of people, this is living the dream. And it&#8217;s not hard to see why.</p><p name=\"2925\" id=\"2925\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Having a job that allows you to make your own hours and travel at the same time is pretty cool. But it&#8217;s not always easy.</p><p name=\"e450\" id=\"e450\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So let&#8217;s talk about how you can get started. We&#8217;ll discuss some of the best resources you can take advantage of, and some things to watch out for along the way.</p><h3 name=\"dfa4\" id=\"dfa4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Set Realistic Expectations of Remote&#160;Work</h3><p name=\"5fa6\" id=\"5fa6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">First off, let&#8217;s get one thing straight. The beach is an awful place to work. You may have tried it once or twice to make all of our friends back home jealous of your incredible new lifestyle. But the fact of the matter is:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"76ef\" id=\"76ef\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The beach has no WiFi.</li><li name=\"276f\" id=\"276f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Sand and salt mess up your computer (sand + magsafe adapter = no fun)</li><li name=\"9a90\" id=\"9a90\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">You get horrible sun glare on your monitor.</li></ul><p name=\"b770\" id=\"b770\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">And there are a hundred other reasons why you don&#8217;t actually want to try and work on a beach.</p><p name=\"bad8\" id=\"bad8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The reality of remote work is you&#8217;ll probably be spending most of your time in cafes, co-working spaces, public areas with wifi, and at home. And that&#8217;s great! There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that!</p><p name=\"9e95\" id=\"9e95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And for the record, all those people posting ridiculous photos of their &#8220;office for the day&#8221; are mostly full of it.</p><p name=\"b44c\" id=\"b44c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take it from me&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I&#8217;ve personally gone to these sorts of satirical extremes:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*V_BGoeWTI1XBXo6g8H_H_A.jpeg\">Cloud Computing<h3 name=\"9b3f\" id=\"9b3f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Challenges That Remote Developers Face</h3><p name=\"945c\" id=\"945c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Some of the biggest challenges that remote developers face while working abroad are:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"3685\" id=\"3685\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Unreliable/slow wifi</li><li name=\"5ab1\" id=\"5ab1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Finding consistent places to work (daytime/nighttime)</li><li name=\"a2bb\" id=\"a2bb\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Being surrounded by people on vacation (while you need to clock in hours for work)</li><li name=\"79d5\" id=\"79d5\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Coordinating work with people in different timezones</li><li name=\"902c\" id=\"902c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Finding places to hop on a call with your coworkers/clients</li><li name=\"6206\" id=\"6206\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Navigating the legal issues around working remotely abroad without a work permit</li><li name=\"a617\" id=\"a617\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Staying focused while making your own hours</li></ul><p name=\"4eaf\" id=\"4eaf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">These may not seem like particularly big challenges at first, but when you&#8217;re on the road for a while they really start to pile up. And the more inconveniences you have, the more difficult it is to keep a steady routine.</p><h3 name=\"cfd4\" id=\"cfd4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">What About The Good&#160;Stuff?</h3><p name=\"edc7\" id=\"edc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now that we&#8217;ve cut through a lot of the difficult stuff, why don&#8217;t we dig into the juicy bits. What makes remote work great?</p><p name=\"56bb\" id=\"56bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote work can be extremely rewarding if you get into a good groove with it. One of the best things about it is that even if you are working 40&#8211;50 hours week (or often more for business owners), as soon as you&#8217;re on a break, you get to pop out for lunch in Japan, or go for an after-work surf in Bali, or zip home on your scooter through some luscious green rice paddies in Vietnam.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XyXfeq0hO8EAsbrytGjPNQ.jpeg\"><p name=\"4a5d\" id=\"4a5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">You&#8217;ll start to notice that even if you don&#8217;t have many of the luxuries you might have back home (a car, a 4K TV, your blazing fast wifi, your entire home being automated with a Raspberry Pi), the novelty of living in a drastically different environment is a very fulfilling experience.</p><p name=\"a1c3\" id=\"a1c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s really the novelty of all the small interactions you have outside of work, the places you get to explore on evenings and weekends or on a particularly nice afternoon that make remote work extremely satisfying. You get to make friends with locals, learn as much of a new language as you can, and soak in all that incredible culture.</p><blockquote name=\"fb56\" id=\"fb56\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted.&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Bill&#160;Bryson</blockquote><h3 name=\"2e07\" id=\"2e07\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote\">How To Get&#160;Started</h3><p name=\"cc21\" id=\"cc21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">There are a few ways of going about getting started with remote work&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;either by getting a new job, taking on freelance work, or negotiating with your boss.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mKLp353kSvm-vuvENkDgBQ.jpeg\"><p name=\"0753\" id=\"0753\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Method #1: Find a remote job on a website like <a href=\"https://remoteok.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RemoteOK</a> or any one of these <a href=\"https://skillcrush.com/2014/10/10/sites-finding-remote-work/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">25 other websites</a>.</p><p name=\"cc91\" id=\"cc91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Method #2: Find some freelance work opportunities through friends and acquaintances to build a client base. Or try websites like <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Upwork</a> or <a href=\"http://toptal.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Toptal</a>.</p><p name=\"47fc\" id=\"47fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Method #3: Negotiate a few small baby steps for remote work with your boss, then knock it out of the park. Try a couple days, then push for a couple weeks. Read <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5989936/how-can-i-convince-my-boss-to-let-me-work-from-home\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this Lifehacker article</a> on how to convince your boss.</p><h3 name=\"d5e1\" id=\"d5e1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Word To The Wise (a few little&#160;tips)</strong></h3><p name=\"7c1b\" id=\"7c1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The biggest factors in making your remote work experience successful is maintaining a balanced healthy and sustainable lifestyle. So start establishing some routines.</p><h4 name=\"41c4\" id=\"41c4\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Do you normally cook/work out?</strong></h4><p name=\"a881\" id=\"a881\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Eating out all the time is an easy (and delicious) trap to fall into. Make sure you find ways to keep a healthy diet, and not be too frequently seduced by the tasty but junky tourist food. Work out? Find a gym, go for runs, or find some ways to get that exercise in.</p><h4 name=\"a40a\" id=\"a40a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Do you have a&#160;routine?</strong></h4><p name=\"9f40\" id=\"9f40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Set some standard office hours for yourself and stick to them. Wake up early and get your brain working, make a cup of tea, go for a walk and get the day started. It&#8217;s ok to stray away from the routine here and there but for the most part keep it consistent.</p><h4 name=\"1119\" id=\"1119\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Do you have a steady&#160;spot?</strong></h4><p name=\"b06e\" id=\"b06e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Where are you going to be working from day to day? Find a cafe that has decent wifi and is open during the hours you need to work. Not enough? Then get a membership at a co-working space, hint they have awesome places all over the world. Scout out some great spots on <a href=\"http://workfrom.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Workfrom</a>.</p><h4 name=\"3bdd\" id=\"3bdd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Do you have a vague idea of where to travel&#160;to?</strong></h4><p name=\"3810\" id=\"3810\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">You don&#8217;t have to have things planned out to a T. But getting some opinions on nice places to go that have reliable internet, great 4G SIM cards (major bonus points for places like Thailand and Taiwan).</p><p name=\"0ce3\" id=\"0ce3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The best places to start your search is on <a href=\"http://nomadlist.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NomadList</a>. You can filter by weather, ease of access, cost of living, internet speeds, and much more.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CHKa6kZRcq4R_Fmy8SaavQ.png\"><p name=\"3fc3\" id=\"3fc3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Do you have people around you who are working too?<br></strong>Hanging around in hostels and the like can be challenging because everyone you&#8217;ll meet will likely be on vacation. Not the ideal scenario for you, someone who is trying to take on sustainable long-term travel. Find others like yourself who are working remotely and you&#8217;ll benefit immensely.</p><h3 name=\"456a\" id=\"456a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Learn From&#160;Others</h3><p name=\"af67\" id=\"af67\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Over the course of your travels, you&#8217;ll meet lots of incredibly talented developers and entrepreneurs. One thing I&#8217;d emphasize more than anything else I&#8217;ve mentioned so far is to take advantage of opportunities to meet them.</p><p name=\"fb53\" id=\"fb53\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Check out <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meetup.com</a> and find events near you. Go to co-working spaces and find local startups to meet with.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*u2lv8soB-nostZeTSyRU-Q.jpeg\"><p name=\"a620\" id=\"a620\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Being exposed to developers and entrepreneurs from all over the world is one of the most educational and rewarding experiences you&#8217;ll have. It will open your mind to diverse perspectives, philosophies, and expertise. There&#8217;s really nothing like it.</p><h3 name=\"807c\" id=\"807c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">What About Co-working Retreats?</h3><p name=\"a651\" id=\"a651\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Some people call them co-working retreats, others call them co-workations. There are a million different names for these types of events.</p><p name=\"f356\" id=\"f356\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One way or another, you&#8217;ve probably heard murmurs or gotten ads on Facebook about how to travel around the world for a year with a group of like-minded people. As a matter of fact, that&#8217;s how I started my work-travel adventure. For a year, I was the Trip Facilitator for a group called <a href=\"http://www.hackerparadise.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker Paradise</a>.</p><p name=\"aa05\" id=\"aa05\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today, these types of retreats are a dime a dozen. Everyone and their uncle has started some sort of travel+work, yoga+coworking, surfing+coworking retreat, and they can vary significantly in length, quality and price. Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://coworkations.co/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whole list of ones you can check out</a>.</p><p name=\"eaf1\" id=\"eaf1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My only word of advice here is be careful and read lots of reviews before making a big commitment.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vr_KeALPiGu3aNO66dubRw.jpeg\"><p name=\"f0fc\" id=\"f0fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Recent bootcamp grad? Have a long think about this decision? Immediately delving into long term travel by yourself is probably a mistake. Your biggest goal right now should be to hack on new projects, contribute to open source, and solidify and build upon all the skills you&#8217;ve learned.</p><p name=\"6134\" id=\"6134\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That being said, while you&#8217;re looking for work, joining a co-working retreat for developers for a few weeks could prove to be extremely beneficial. It could get you collaborating with brilliant developers. Together, you could hack on fun projects. You could build an incredible network of people who can share opportunities, connections, and advice.</p><h3 name=\"25f6\" id=\"25f6\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Long Story&#160;Short</h3><p name=\"1a08\" id=\"1a08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Want to work and travel? Awesome! Find a way and make it happen. Talk to successful people you know who&#8217;ve done it and ask for advice. Just like learning to code, you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p><p name=\"5498\" id=\"5498\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">DRY: Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself. Just like in programming, you don&#8217;t need to reinvent the wheel. Take advantage of all the awesome tools and resources people use to make their work/travel lives easier and more effective.</p><p name=\"20a9\" id=\"20a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take advantage of the incredible people you&#8217;ll meet and learn from them. Keep those connections close and they will inevitably come back to benefit you later.</p><p name=\"a72b\" id=\"a72b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Good luck and happy travels! Questions?
