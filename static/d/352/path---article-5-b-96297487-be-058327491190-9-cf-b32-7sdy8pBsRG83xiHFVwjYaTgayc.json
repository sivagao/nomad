I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them. This is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes. I also share here what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>What I was up to other than here:</h2><ul><li>I did an <a href=\"http://glamouroustraveller.com/2014/10/03/interview-with-rachel-from-hippie-in-heels/\" target=\"_blank\"><p>interview on Glamourous Traveler</p></a> about fashion &amp; travel</li><li>I&#8217;m up to something secret this week. I&#8217;ll give you a hint&#8230; you might see me on tv for few minutes ;) Say a little prayer that I don&#8217;t have an anxiety attack this weekend over it!</li><li>I am also losing complete motivation to learn Hindi. Everyone speaks English so I have no one to practice with!</li></ul><h1>Now your story,</h1><p>It hit me out of nowhere- I wasn&#8217;t even sure what happened but I had been pushed to the ground and my housekeeper was at my side helping me back up. I started to cry and said like a super proper girl would, &#8220;what the fuck was that!!?&#8221;</p><p>Now, I&#8217;m no electrician&#8230; but from what I gather&#8230; it&#8217;s NOT advisable to place your thumb directly on the metal of an exposed plug.</p><p>Our lamp was plugged in, but the plastic bits on the plug had fallen off (cheap ass lamp plug&#8230;) and it was two little pieces of metal exposed. I tried to unplug it and pushed my thumb right onto the metal.</p><p>While American voltage is about 120, Indian voltage is a staggering 230.</p><p>So, yeah I got blown back. My thumb had a huge electrical burn and I couldn&#8217;t feel my hand for an hour.</p><p>This really has more to do with a blonde moment than India, but hey at least you learned an important lesson about voltage- imagine what it can do to your electronics! Here&#8217;s to hoping I don&#8217;t get electrocuted in India again.</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>&#160;</p><p>Did you enjoy this post?
