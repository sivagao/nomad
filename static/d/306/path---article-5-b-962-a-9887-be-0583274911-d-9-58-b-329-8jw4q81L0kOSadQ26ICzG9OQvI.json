There are about 10 main tourist places in Arunachal Pradesh to visit and Dirang is one of the smaller ones. I&#8217;m glad we stopped though and want to share the things to do in Dirang that we found during our two days there.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12412\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley36.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\">We basically spent one day there on our way North, then again one day on our way back down South. It&#8217;s a good stopover and there are a couple decent hotels in Dirang and a handful of attractions or places to visit in Dirang and Dirang valley. You&#8217;re also only 15 km from Sangti Valley which is totally worth a visit and this is a good place to come back to for rest since there is no accommodation in Sangti.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12409\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley33.jpg?resize=560%2C379&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"379\"></p><h1>Places to Visit in Dirang Arunachal Pradesh</h1><p>Dirang was two hours North of Bomdila by road (which is the only way to get there). We went to our hotel first for lunch. We stayed at&#160;<strong>Pemaling Hotel Dirang </strong>which is the #1 hotel in&#160;Dirang&#8230;. out of <i>one</i>. Their brochure says it&#8217;s the oldest hotel in town built in 1999, but if it&#8217;s the only one, maybe that means it&#8217;s the newest too, ha ha. There is also B&amp;B called Hotel Samdup Khang.&#160;I didn&#8217;t check it out myself, but at least there is a backup is Pemaling is full.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12407\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley31.jpg?resize=560%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang pemaling hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"560\">Ask for a room with a view! Surprisingly, this hotel didn&#8217;t have local Tibetan food but had &#8220;Intercontinental/Indian&#8221; style. We went for the Chinese. The food was decent overall, but to be honest it was the only option!&#160;Obviously there aren&#8217;t a lot of Dirang hotels to choose from but either way, I recommend the Pemaling. We didn&#8217;t have any problems.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley39.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12414\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley38.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\">The photos above are from one woman&#8217;s house who invited us in. She recognized Sange and asked if we would like some tea. I had been having too much tea so would just get hot water. We didn&#8217;t speak English so we kind of sat in silence drinking. You can see her loom where she is making traditional bags and shirts to sell.</p><p>Her kids were in the back studying with the older one teaching the younger ones. These smaller moments were some of the best and wouldn&#8217;t have been possible if we were walking through the village on our own. It&#8217;s good when in Tribal areas to have a guide who knows people.</p><h2>1. Dirang Dzong</h2><p>We wandering Dirang and went to a place called <strong>Dirang Dzong</strong> which is a tribal area with a 9th century prison. There are a couple of houses around it and the Grandmother of Sange, our guide, used to live in one of them! Some are 500 or 600 years old. Just a few feet from the prison was a Monastery. The prison seems large for such a SMALL town but apparently people were sent from other towns to Dirang. Sometimes this area is referred to as Dirang Fort.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12406\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley30.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\">On the left is the monastery, the right is the prison</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12394\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley18.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12413\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley37.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12411\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley35.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12410\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley34.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p>We went inside one of the homes to see what it was like. There were SO many pots and pans hanging on the walls of the kitchen. Apparently, it&#8217;s really a sign of wealth (wealth may be the wrong term, but it&#8217;s like they are proud of them and want to show them off, like look how many I have!). The woman made sure we took a photo of hers.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12399\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley23.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12398\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley22.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12396\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley20.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12397\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley21.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\">the stairs</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12395\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley19.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><h2>2.&#160;Kalachakra Gompa</h2><p>This is the oldest monastery in Arunachal Pradesh, over 500 years old. It&#8217;s in a smaller village in Dirang called Kalachakra, hence the name. Not that many people come here anymore, except local Buddhists.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12418\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dirang-monastery.jpg?resize=483%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"dirang monastery\" width=\"483\" height=\"560\"></p><h2>3. Himalayan Culture &amp; Tradition Preservation Society</h2><p>This is going to be the newest monastery in the area once it&#8217;s built. The man in the photo is a good friend of the Dalai Lama&#8217;s (current one, 14th). They went to school together since they were kids. As a trusted friend, he has been the one to open many new monasteries. He&#8217;s a well-known and respected monk. I told him I liked his hat and he said,&#160;&#8220;take it! I want you to have it&#8221;.&#160;I told him I couldn&#8217;t possibly take it and that he should keep it. The next thing I know he&#8217;s gone and found two more hats and given them to Anna and I. He said&#160;&#8220;oh and it matches your clothes&#8221;. Love it!!</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12408\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley32.jpg?resize=560%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\">This is going to be a learning center where even foreigners can come to learn. They want the locals to learn to pray as well so that it&#8217;s not always the monks doing the praying. People will learn Tibetan and keep their culture alive. They were working on the building while we were there: building, painting, and decorating.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12416\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_20151105_091115_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12417\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_20151105_091359_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><h2>4. Sangti Valley</h2><p>Sangti Valley is the best on this list but is just a little bit outside of Dirang. About 30 minutes in the car with their bumpy roads. I took so many photos here and loved walking around seeing all the local people in this stunning area. There was a sheep farm on top of the hill looking into the valley. It was a gorgeous view! I&#8217;ll be posting about Sangti Valley next.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12386\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley10.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sangti valley\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12378\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sangti-valley2.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"places to visit in dirang\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\">Overall, Dirang isn&#8217;t one of the top tourist places of India that a typical backpacker would have on their list. Dirang tourism doesn&#8217;t really exist yet. I hope you saw that there are attractions in Dirang worth seeing and that it&#8217;s really not the destination it&#8217;s the experience. If you&#8217;re coming all this way North, do make a stop!</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Did you enjoy this post? Let me know in the comments or by sharing it with the social media links!
