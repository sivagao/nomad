It's called photogrammetry, it's really cool and looks like this:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"875\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8161 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You can also use hundreds of cameras to do it:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Photogrammetry.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"822\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8162 responsively-lazy\"> <p>The idea behind photogrammetry is that you take lots of photos (50 to 1,000 to even more) from different angles of an object, left, right, up, down, front, behind and software then stitches together lots of photos (from 50 to 1,000).</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/botetourt1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1253\" height=\"748\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8163 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It figures out the angle each photo is taken at and based on the differences between the photos figures out 3d depth data. It creates something called a \"point cloud\" of 3d points:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/3dselect2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1198\" height=\"954\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8164 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Does it work?</h2> <p>Now, you'd think that photogrammetry would be nice in theory, but in practice? Well, it actually works really really well. So well that in many cases it's sharper than an average infrared or laser based 3d scanner.</p> <h2>How to do it?</h2> <p>First, take lots of photos of your object. In my case, I shot pics of a classic ornament in my parents old house that they want to 3d print for their new house. I know, I know, it looks demonic AF:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0438.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8165 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0436.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8166 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0423.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8167 responsively-lazy\"> <p>After 50 pics:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.27.40-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1972\" height=\"1106\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8140 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Second, send your photos to your computer (use Airdrop etc.).</p> <p>Third, upload those photos to <a href=\"http://recap360.autodesk.com/\">Autodesk Recap 360</a>. That's a web app front end for Autodesk's 3d processing servers. You'll need to make a free Autodesk account, login and you can upload.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.26.08-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2622\" height=\"1558\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8142 responsively-lazy\"> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.25.54-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2624\" height=\"1378\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8143 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You then get back a 3d model. You can view it in 3d on Autodesk's site.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-22-at-2.12.14-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2582\" height=\"1642\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8120 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Better yet, you can download the 3d model as an zip file that has 3 files.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.34.02-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"462\" height=\"158\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8137 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You get an .OBJ 3d model:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.34.48-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1594\" height=\"1008\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8158 responsively-lazy\"> <p>.. a material file .MTL and a texture file as a .JPG that's simply a raw image of the textures it projects on your 3d object.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-21-at-5.35.59-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1454\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8133 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>What to do with your 3d object?</h2> <p>There's 3 things you can do now:</p> <h3>Share it online</h3> <p>To share your object with the world, you can upload it to a site like <a href=\"http://sketchfab.com/\">Sketchfab</a>. It's a 3d model sharing community where anyone can upload, download and share 3d objects, not just 3d scans. Here's my model:</p> <p class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"></p> <h3>Augmented Reality</h3> <p>Thing is, Sketchfab also have a great mobile app for iOS and they just introduced AR with iOS11's ARKit. That means with a few taps you can place your 3d object back in IRL:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One more thing &#128522; you can put your 3d scanned object back IRL into &#10024;Augmented Reality with <a href=\"//twitter.com/Sketchfab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sketchfab</a>&#8217;s mobile app <a href=\"//t.co/5qW244kvlo\">pic.twitter.com/5qW244kvlo</a></p> <p>&#8212; Pieter Levels @ &#127475;&#127473; (@levelsio) <a href=\"//twitter.com/levelsio/status/921797078216531968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote> <p></p> <h3>Virtual Reality</h3> <p>If you have a VR headset or phone that supports it, the Sketchfab app also allows you to watch it with that. If you want to use your 3d object to make a game around, download <a href=\"http://unity3d.com/\">Unity3d</a>, and you can make a VR game with it (<a href=\"/from-web-dev-to-vr-dev/\">as I'm doing</a>). Otherwise you can edit it in 3d with <a href=\"//www.maxon.net/\">Cinema4D</a>.</p> <p>Plenty of options!</p> <h3>3d printing</h3> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/29.si_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8169 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Any .OBJ file you can send to a 3d printer company and they can help you convert it into a 3d object to print. Some new <a href=\"//i.materialise.com/blog/how-3d-printing-in-multiple-colors-works/\">3d printers can print in full color</a> now, but most still print a solid color, so you'll have to paint it yourself.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/29.si_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8169 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>What should I scan?</h2> <p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/male_human-3b_highlights_blog.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8170 responsively-lazy\"><br> Try scanning someone's face. They'll need to sit still and the background needs to be somewhat empty and flat. You can use a white bed cloth and hold it behind for better results. Or if you have a DSLR camera, use its depth of field to make sure the background is blurry. The less background you get in the picture, the better idea the processing has of the object in the foreground you want a 3d model of.</p> <p>An example of how I did it wrong today, with too much background stuff going on so that there wasn't enough detail in the object (the head/face).</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-22-at-3.12.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2156\" height=\"1556\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8171 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You can also scan nostalgic objects from your childhood, so you can save them in case they're lost. You'll be able to watch them from anywhere you are just on your phone.</p> <p>Also think of touristic monuments you've been to that you want to save. The process is still wieldy, but it might be fun to try.</p> <h2>What's the limitations?</h2> <p>Photogrammetry isn't perfect (yet). Best results are with static objects that you can move around. </p> <p>It also might take a few tries to get it right. And Autodesk's Recap360 is now limited to 50 photos per scan, which is fine for an individual object. But too limited for real big projects. They have a paid Windows app though (whyyyyy Windows and not OSX?!). But their entire product payment and download flow is absolutely horrid, so I'd just stick to the web app!</p> <p>Photogrammetry does particularly bad with big areas like rooms where it has to figure out how every picture overlaps. In those cases it's still better to use a real 3d scanner like <a href=\"//matterport.com/\">Matterport</a>, that I bought to 3d scan my parents house. That one uses infrared to get depth. It's less sharp with individual objects, but for big spaces it works better.</p> <h2>Enjoy!</h2> <p>Photogrammetry is cool new tech to play with. It's not perfect yet, but rapidly improving. And it's an example of a tech we need in the future to bridge the IRL world with the virtual. Because wouldn't you want all your stuff in your VR beach house?
