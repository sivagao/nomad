Financial district, is in the heart of Toronto with a number of great restaurants, sports centers, shopping and of course, spas.</p><p class=\"p1\">Working in finance for nearly 10 years, I have provided recommendations for clients, colleagues and travellers to cater to their preferences and time. Financial district, quiet on the weekend, is hustling and bustling during the week and easily accessible through the internal PATH system or outdoors.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14605\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7220.jpg?resize=560%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Toronto Financial District\" width=\"560\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14604\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_6958.jpg?resize=420%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Toronto Financial District\" width=\"420\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes </i></b><b><i>the Financial district&#160;</i></b><b><i>a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Being in the heart of downtown Toronto, there are a number of fabulous restaurants that will tantalize taste buds to each corner of the world.

Definitely during TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival).</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_5785.jpg?resize=421%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Toronto Financial District\" width=\"421\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.edgewalkcntower.ca/\"><strong>CN Tower&#8217;s Edgewalk</strong></a>, which holds the title of the world&#8217;s highest full-circle, hands free walk on a 5 foot ledge that circles the main pod of the tower, 1,168 feet or 114 storeys above ground.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Maman in First Canadian Place is a great place for a &#8220;non-corporate&#8221; caf&#233; environment as it transports you to a sweet European caf&#233; where you can order pressed coffee, loaves and even a cocktail should you feel like it &#9786;</p><p class=\"p1\">Take a walk around the downtown area and you will find spots that you will enjoy, the green spaces can be rare but when you find a patch take advantage of it.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0331.jpg?resize=560%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Toronto Financial District\" width=\"560\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in the financial district&#160;and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Special occasions, I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.thechasetoronto.com/\"><strong>The Chase</strong></a>. These are two of my favourite restaurants for special occasions. The Chase offers incredible food, and an extensive but pricey wine list. The menu switches up, but is never disappointing with a great little patio with a better view than post places. </p><p class=\"p1\">Big date night? <a href=\"http://mercatto.ca/\"><strong>Mercatto</strong></a> on Toronto Street is a sweet spot with great Italian food and ambience. Feel like ramping it up a bit more? Check out George Restaurant which providing patrons with a great tasting menu.

Are there designers we should make sure to meet?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">You can never go wrong with shopping in downtown Toronto. Whether you&#8217;re looking for designer handbags, couture dresses or well-made pair of jeans.

Tequila lovers, go to Reposado which has a fantastic array of tequila that doesn&#8217;t make you feel like you are 19. Pravda is a well-known vodka bar that plays the Russian national anthem at midnight, then you get the samba group up on the bar and if you&#8217;re still standing, maybe you will get to do a vodka tasting in their chilly vodka room. </p><p class=\"p1\">New to Toronto, CC Lounge is a whiskey bar but turns into a club on the weekends. It&#8217;s more chilled out during the weekdays but if you are looking to party.. these would be some places near financial district.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.travellingchingrita.com\">Alexandra Lam</a> is a&#160;lover of food, wine, travel and surfing living in Toronto, Canada.
