Things from video calling technology to email services, all of these provide better ways to me to communicate with a team, whether I&#8217;m speaking to the team in India, the CEO in the US or a team in Birmingham, resources make everything work like clock-work.</p><p name=\"ec54\" id=\"ec54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Out of the many 100s of resources I&#8217;ve decided to pick five top apps that have been helping me recently towards working remotely.</p><h3 name=\"71b1\" id=\"71b1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Escape&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;for distractions</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hWmISPLAqFGMZoiduBXJLg.png\"><p name=\"ad16\" id=\"ad16\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Famously a great way to keep track of my distractions. One of the most prolific thing is a remote worker is distractions. Seeing as you aren&#8217;t around a team, you are more prone to the temptations of distracting yourself.</p><p name=\"0d91\" id=\"0d91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;ve managed to improve this hugely over the last few months and on my last remote working stint in 2014, but sometimes we are human. Escape for Mac aims to track the sites you visit, and embarrass you with the amount of time you got distracted. This data can prove very handy, whether it&#8217;s being distracted every 13 minutes or 34 minutes, this can help cut your unnecessary visits to Facebook or Twitter.</p><p name=\"a1bf\" id=\"a1bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://focuslist.co/escape/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out!</a></p><h3 name=\"db81\" id=\"db81\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Bear&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;for beautiful notes</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ToCS1cVFyOVqnCaZKnsClg.png\"><p name=\"b0b2\" id=\"b0b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Note-taking has historically been a memorable experience. Ideas and inspiration comes from notes, that&#8217;s what makes it a beautiful experience. Bear Notes has introduced a new and distraction-free note-taking experience for Mac and iOS. It&#8217;s impressive, working natively on both devices, its perfect for those looking to get some distraction-free work done, ideal for those who write and great for those who simply like to dump ideas and thoughts.</p><p name=\"cd92\" id=\"cd92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For remote work, that&#8217;s important, making sure you get quality work done is the goal and Bear helps me craft my best pieces of writing, where I feel most rewarded. Bear Notes is a fantastic note-taking solution, well worth checking out.</p><p name=\"6713\" id=\"6713\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://bear-writer.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out!</a></p><h3 name=\"7070\" id=\"7070\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Newton&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;for intelligent email</strong></h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1nQEgHX2n0aZpQtgrebIMQ.png\"><p name=\"30f9\" id=\"30f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Being able to track the progress of an email is something I never even considered to be beneficial. But as a remote worker and freelancer, this concept has become even more valuable by the day. Tracking whether an email has been opened in real-time combined with &#8220;send later&#8221; where I can now send emails for a scheduled date in the future has been saving me hours of time, especially as I&#8217;m working for companies in both the UK and India.</p><p name=\"2cdc\" id=\"2cdc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These features have been residing in one of the best email experiences, Newton. It&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ve ever wanted in an email experience and one of my most used resources to helping me get my remote work done.</p><p name=\"15f2\" id=\"15f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://newtonhq.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out!</a></p><h3 name=\"ad99\" id=\"ad99\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Timezone.io&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;for work/life balance</h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*m5-IWjolYx-ftYgrHDvlLA.jpeg\"><p name=\"91c4\" id=\"91c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Working out what time it is around the world is sometimes pretty tough without a calculator, with all of your items you have to do its one of the last things you should have to worry about. I used to have to Google &#8220;Google, what&#8217;s the time in ______&#8221; every single time. Now it&#8217;s much easier.</p><p name=\"3dff\" id=\"3dff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Having all of my timezones on one dashboard is not only a time-saver but it&#8217;s a real life-saving when it comes to interacting with customers, colleagues and friends. Timezone.io is my go to app for setting this up, I actually discovered this from a recommendation by the fully remote <a href=\"http://www.doist.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Doist</a> team. Kudos to them!</p><p name=\"592a\" id=\"592a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"http://timezone.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out!</a></p><h3 name=\"dc07\" id=\"dc07\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Slack&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;for real-time communication</strong></h3><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1hRJHTE_1dXLoFabxMt-zw.png\"><p name=\"05c0\" id=\"05c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">You must have heard of Slack, an many of you have. If you haven&#8217;t I&#8217;d love to know in the comments where you have been. Slack is one of the most used tools for chatting with the team. It&#8217;s well-designed and easy to use, it&#8217;s like Facebook Messenger for your work friends. They&#8217;ve recently introduced a new feature called Threads which I&#8217;m yet to fully use, apparently it&#8217;s great to starting discussions without bombarding your &#8220;channels&#8221; (basically groups) on Slack. Slack is free to download an great for small and large teams to get connected. A remote workers must, even if it&#8217;s a team of 2, your private WhatsApp chat can get messy!</p><p name=\"0570\" id=\"0570\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"http://slack.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out!</a></p></div>","title":"Remote working? 5 Apps for your Toolkit – The Mission – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b93835087be056953db7e4d"}}
