There&#8217;s a brand new Bangkok hotel near BTS Saphan Taksin called The House of Phraya Jasaen. It&#8217;s warm, welcoming, and charming and just between you and us, it&#8217;s among the best hotels in Bangkok we&#8217;ve ever stayed at in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>The House of Phraya Jasaen (pronounces prah-ya jah-sain) is nestled on a lively soi, Soi 57 off Charoen Krung Road in Sathorn to be exact, filled with long-time family-owned shops. In fact, this brand new hotel (as of August 2015) is in a historic area of Bangkok where not much has changed in terms of the atmosphere since the 1960s.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14173\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Chareon-Krung-Road-2.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"he House of Phraya Jasaen, a Bangkok hotel near BTS Saphan Taksin and Central Pier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>One morning over coffee, we chatted with the hotel&#8217;s two co-owners and learned that the hotel was created by merging seven antique shophouses. Much of the original walls, room structure, and hallways remain intact and make for an interesting layout of the 32 guest rooms within the four-story building.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s what&#8217;s inside these rooms that caught our attention.&#160;This is where it gets fun!</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Check_Out_the_Rooms_at_The_House_of_Phraya_Jasaen\">Check Out the Rooms at The House of Phraya Jasaen</p></h2>\n<img class=\"wp-image-14174 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Circle-Room.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen | Circle Room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p>One of the owners of the hotel is a Thai interior designer&#160;who studied in Chicago, USA. He not only single-handedly oversaw the transformation from shophouses to boutique hotel, but he also painstakingly designed and decorated every room in fourteen separate styles.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-14175\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Safe-House-Room1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen | The Safe House Room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p>From an entirely white (or black) room, a relaxing haven, to a room with a retro circular bed seemingly suspended from the ceiling, we were able to&#160;choose from a variety of sizes, layouts, and d&#233;cor during&#160;our two-night stay.</p>\n<p>Here are a few more snapshots of our favorites:</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-14078\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Cars-Room-26.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen | Cars Room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><p>Goodbye cookie cutter hotel and hello to one that had something different around every corner.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-14176 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Dormitory.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen | Dormitory Room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>Dormitory Room | Equipped with four bunk beds (each with their own reading lamp, mini TV, and outlets) and in-room sink and mini fridge.

Much of the&#160;original teak floors were preserved as was the teak staircase. Other areas feature modern lacquered concrete floors. There are big windows, countless hanging potted plants, and both functional and decorative vertical steel cable suspension wires.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14177\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Reception1.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen | Reception and Lounge Area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"></p>\n<p>The&#160;hotel is reminiscent of an art gallery and has information podiums, hanging cable systems for artwork, open and glass-enclosed display cases, and recessed&#160;lighting. There are also antique items on display using furniture and shelving collected from the families who once lived in the shophouses. Several antique tools, such as a gold cable pulling machine and an old gas pump, are refurbished and now part of the d&#233;cor.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Find current deals for The House of Phraya Jasaen on <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/the-house-of-phraya-jasaen/hotel/bangkok-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/baan-phraya-jasaen.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Booking.com</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<h2><p id=\"A_Quick_Look_at_the_Amenities\">A Quick Look at the Amenities</p></h2>\n<p>In addition to the industrial d&#233;cor, the rooms have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No shortage of three prong outlets and fast, reliable Wifi.

We chatted like old friends and learned a lot about them and the history of the hotel.</p>\n<p>The owners invited us on a bicycle tour of the nearby morning market. Later that day, we had lunch together with one of the&#160;owners. He grabbed a&#160;simple meal of khao mun gai&#160;(Hainanese chicken and rice) from one of the many food stalls set up along the street and presented it at his dining table on plates and silverware from his kitchen.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Things_to_Do_Near_Saphan_Taksin_BTS_and_Central_Pier\">Things to Do Near Saphan Taksin BTS and Central Pier</p></h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s plenty to see and do in the Sathorn area away from the main Sukhumvit strip. If anything, you won&#8217;t have to deal with the overcrowded grimy streets, shopkeepers heckling, or bar girls and ladyboys beckoning from Sukhumvit&#8217;s streetside bars. Instead, a stroll&#160;along Charoen Krung Road reveals there are plenty of small restaurants and shops along the spacious&#160;sidewalks day or evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Less than a half kilometer away from the hotel is the Saphan Taksin BTS (Skytrain) and Central Pier&#160;(water taxi)&#160;stations.</strong> The Central Pier is also known as Tha Sathorn, Sathorn Pier, or simply as Central. The Chao Phraya Express Boats stop at the Central Pier and are a cheap and convenient way to travel around the city.</p>\n<p>Within a reasonable walking distance of the hotel (less than 10 minutes) is a<strong> Robinson shopping center</strong> and the <strong>Bangruk Bazaar (&#3610;&#3634;&#3591;&#3619;&#3633;&#3585; &#3610;&#3634;&#3595;&#3634;&#3619;&#3660;)</strong>.&#160;In the other direction is Bangkok&#8217;s trendy <strong>Asiatique The Riverfront</strong> outdoor center filled with restaurants and boutique shops. It took us about 20 minutes to walk there. If we wanted, we could have also hopped on the free water taxi that goes between&#160;Central Pier and Asiatique.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14179\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Phraya-Jasaen-Main-Street.jpg?resize=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The House of Phraya Jasaen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"><br>\n<strong>Phone:</strong> (026) 759-1989<br>\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> PhrayaJasaen.com or book on <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/the-house-of-phraya-jasaen/hotel/bangkok-th.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agoda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/baan-phraya-jasaen.html?cid=1608701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Booking.com</a><br>\n<strong>Address:</strong> 168 Soi Charoen Krung 57&#160;Yannawa, Sathorn Bangkok 10120</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Disclosure: Our stay at The House of Phraya Jasaen was sponsored in exchange for an honest review.
