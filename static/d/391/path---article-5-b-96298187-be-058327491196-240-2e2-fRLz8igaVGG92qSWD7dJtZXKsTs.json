It&#8217;s not that I want to make fun of people or have a rant- this is just meant to be an honest&#160;portrayal&#160;about my life in India through short anecdotes.]<p>[I always have funny/weird stories about India to share with friends or family when I talk to them, which has inspired this new series! It&#8217;s not that I want to make fun of people or have a rant- this is just meant to be an honest portrayal about my life in India through short anecdotes.]</p><p>We walk into an Indian shop in Little India, Singapore. The Indian man reminds us of home and Ben asks, do you do Indian recharge? The man says, &#8220;you have Indian SIM, Indian phone?&#8221; Ben assures him he does. He tells him he needs 501 Vodafone recharge.</p><p>In case you aren&#8217;t familiar with the recharge process, most people have cell phones with refill-able <a title=\"Save Yourself Hassle: Buy a Local SIM Card in India\" href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/sim-card-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">SIM cards in India</a>. You go to a little shop and the guy will send a text message for you to add credit. You pay him there and he gets a cut for the sale.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4843\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5237-001.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india two\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p>The guy at this Indian shop in Singapore gives his best head wobble (it was a very reassuring &#8216;most likely wobble&#8217;, rather than an I&#8217;m not sure, &#8216;perhaps wobble&#8217;) and takes Ben&#8217;s phone.</p><p>He scrolls through it. He opens the Internet browser. He closes it.</p><p>He flips through the pages of the phone. Then, he pulls out his own cell phone and scrolls through his contact list. We assume he&#8217;s thinking, &#8220;Who in India do I know that does recharge&#8230; I can call them and ask them to do it!&#8221;</p><p>He swtiches back to Ben&#8217;s phone. He opens his text messages. Scrolls a little more. A couple minutes go by with awkward silence.</p><p>Ben says, &#8220;So, you can&#8217;t do recharge&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>The Indian man looks up to the ceiling&#8230; to the right, to the left, anywhere but Ben&#8217;s eyes. Speechless. We take the phone and walk away.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4845\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5239-001.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india two\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p>Now, it would have been simpler to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t do Indian recharge&#8221; but he didn&#8217;t want to say that! It&#8217;s like I have explained before, where you ask the man at the veg stall, &#8220;Do you have celery?&#8221; He assures you he does, walks away, and doesn&#8217;t come back until you are long gone.<strong>&#160;He doesn&#8217;t want to let you down!</strong></p><p>Remember Lesson 1 from last week?</p><h2>Indians don&#8217;t say no!</h2><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4844\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5238-001.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india two\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><strong>When you need to keep this in mind and stay calm: When your driver says he knows where somewhere is, and doesn&#8217;t.</strong> It&#8217;s not always because he&#8217;s ripping you off with the meter. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t want to admit they don&#8217;t know and they think they can ask people along the way in Hindi without you noticing.</p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>&#160;</p><p>Did you enjoy this post?
