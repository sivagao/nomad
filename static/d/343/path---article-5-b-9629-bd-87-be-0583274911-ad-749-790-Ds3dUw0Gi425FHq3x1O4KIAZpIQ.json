It&#8217;s easy to make a stop and only takes an hour if you need to make it quick. We did, as we had to pick our dog up from the kennel (poor Brandi!).</p><p>If you want to stop at Niagara Falls on your way home from Toronto to Ohio, it&#8217;s easy to do just before crossing Rainbow Bridge. From Toronto you get on Queen Elizabeth way to 420E which takes you right to the falls. There are signs everywhere saying to get off at the falls, just follow the arrows. Then after seeing the falls, you can follow signs to &#8220;USA&#8221; or &#8220;Rainbow bridge&#8221; easy peasy!</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11030\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150717_090011_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to stop at niagara falls from toronto to ohio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11031\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150717_090041_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to stop at niagara falls from toronto to ohio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p>Parking at Niagara is easy as well and there were places all over. You can take a boat ride out or you can just take pictures from the sidewalk. There are places to eat and it&#8217;s actually a cute little town withe Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe, and Hershey store.</p><p>Niagara falls was amazing and totally worth a stop! You&#8217;d be crazy not to. In case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the falls, they are 3 waterfalls between NY (USA) and Ontario (Canada) called Horseshoe, American, and Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe falls are the most famous. They are not only a tourist attraction, but they create power!</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11032\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150717_090303_HDR.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"v\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11033\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150717_090526_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to stop at niagara falls from toronto to ohio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150717_090723_HDR-01.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to stop at niagara falls from toronto to ohio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p>In 1901 a school teacher went over in a barrel.
