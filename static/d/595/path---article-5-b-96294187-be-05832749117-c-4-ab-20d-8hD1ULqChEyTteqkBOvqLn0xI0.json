Okay to be fair, I have had a massage at a Raffles before (<strong><a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/my-little-guide-to-istanbul/\">in Instanbul</a>)</strong> but I had not yet laid my head on one of their immensely oversized pillows in their giant King size beds. Now, I have and like that time I was bumped up to business class on British Air, I have now seen how the other half (or 1%) truly lives.</p><p>If you missed last weeks&#8217; post, <a href=\"http://www.hippie-inheels.com/weekend-in-singapore-tips\"><strong>check it out</strong></a> to see why we were in Singapore and what we got up to.</p><h2>Raffles Singapore Review</h2><p>I suppose you&#8217;ve already realized I love the place but I&#8217;d like to share a few photos and show you what you can expect when you stay at the Raffles Singapore hotel. It&#8217;s one of the most iconic and historical buildings in Singapore and dates back to the East India trading company, hence it being named after Mr. Raffles.</p><p>Back then there were Indian workers in Singapore and you&#8217;ll notice Indian touches at the hotel &#8211; for example the Tiffin Room where you have High Tea. Tiffins are &#8220;lunchboxes&#8221; Indians used for work. We actually thought the hotel reminded us a lot of Taj properties, one of the best chains in India.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16703 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review14.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16704 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review15.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16694 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review5.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16693 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review4.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\">There are a few must do&#8217;s in Singapore and awesomely two of them are right in the Raffles hotel! See my <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/singapore-neighborhood-guide/\"><strong>favorite things to do in Singapore in this post</strong></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d3471394-Reviews-Raffles_High_Tea-Singapore.html\"><strong>Tripadvisor</strong></a> puts Raffles High Tea at the #2 coffee/tea place in the country. The second big thing is having a Singapore Sling where they were invented- right here! They were made because us ladies wanted to drink too &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t classy- so an awesome man invented this so it would look like we were drinking fruit punch of sorts.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16700 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review11.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16687 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Singapore-Doms-Wedding3.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16701 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review12.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16688 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Singapore-Doms-Wedding4.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\">The High Tea was very fancy. In fact when Ben walked in he realized he should go back to the room and change into his button up shirt instead of a t-shirt. While there were regular High Tea offerings, there were also a few bits of local food like dumplings.</p><p>We stayed in the Palm Suites room which came with Butlers (yes, I swear). Of course, we only called them once. That was at 8 am when I woke up with a crashing hangover and no water. I called for four bottles. I could have drunk the sea at that point. Our lady butler came in and could tell I&#8217;d had a late one&#8230; okay, maybe it wasn&#8217;t 8 am, it could have been about 130 pm. She said I should flush my system and have some chamomile tea. I liked her!<br> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-16695 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review6.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16697 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review8.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16699\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review10.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16691\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review2.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16690 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16685 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Singapore-Doms-Wedding1.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\">They gave complimentary fruit baskets, water, tea, and coffee (but not the glass bottled water, it&#8217;s $14). The rooms had a little living area, bedroom, and bathroom with a tub.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16698 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review9.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16696 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review7.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\">We were given the &#8220;writer&#8217;s room&#8221; which was really adorable. Definitely historical, these rooms were rooms of the past which I LOVED. The wood was all dark, there were shutters separating rooms, and the writers desk and vanity were so cute. Ben had a bath (because British people love that nonsense) and I of course didn&#8217;t because that&#8217;s like laying in a hot water pool of your own dirt and I can&#8217;t understand it unless you shower first.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16686 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Singapore-Doms-Wedding2.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\">Overall, it was a great experience and if you&#8217;ve got the budget for it you should absolutely crash here. There is a great rooftop pool, exercise room, a lobby filled with fresh flowers each day, and 14 restaurants and bars on site- including the famous Long Bar where you have the traditional Singapore Sling.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16684 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Singapore-Doms-Wedding.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16692 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review3.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16702 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review13.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16705 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review16.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16706\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Raffles-Singapore-Review17.jpg?resize=560%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"raffles singapore review iconic hotel\" width=\"560\" height=\"416\"></p><p>I stayed at the Raffles as a guest and was not compensated or requested to write a positive review for them.
