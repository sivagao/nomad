Here is our best recommendation for coming out on top against the greedy banksters!</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2><p>What is a Foreign ATM Fee?</p></h2>\n<p>Simply put, a foreign ATM fee is a charge that banks slam you with for using an ATM outside of their home country.</p>\n<p>We had heard horror stories about the outrageous fees imposed by US based banks on foreign ATM withdrawals. This is actually slapped on top of the fee charged by each individual ATM, which happens to be 150 baht ($5 USD) a pop in Thailand. We found that most US banks charge an average 3% foreign ATM fee on each withdrawal.<br>\n</p>\n<p>For example, if we were to withdrawal $500 to pay our rent, we would be slammed with a $15 foreign transaction fee plus the $5 ATM withdrawal fee. That&#8217;s a whopping $20 in fees just to access our own money. And because we rarely are able to pay with a credit card (Thailand is a predominantly cash based economy) we need to make a second withdrawal of $700 to cover our various living expenses. That is $46 a month &#8211; a minimum of <strong>$552 a year in fees</strong> &#8211; if we used a bank that didn&#8217;t have our best interests in mind! </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re truly on a budget, $554 in yearly fees isn&#8217;t something that you can just simply shrug your shoulders at. Luckily, we found a way to avoid this headache completely.</p>\n<p>After doing a few hours of research, we came across the <a title=\"Open an Account Here\" href=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account/checking_account_faqs\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account</a>. As far as we could gather they were (and still are) the only bank that would not impose a foreign ATM fee.&#160; And get this&#8230;they actually reimburse you for every withdrawal fee levied by ATMs on an unlimited amount withdrawals. During our first month here, when we frequented the ATM five times or more for various reasons trying to settle in, we were absolutely slammed with fees. We made sure to use our Charles Schwab ATM/Debit card for every transaction and at the end of the month noticed we had been reimbursed for each withdrawal for a total of $35.71 back in our pockets. We couldn&#8217;t believe it. We surely expected that we would be stuck eating the bill for at least one or two of the transactions, but we were quickly proven wrong.</p>\n<h2><p>Things to Consider When Choosing a Bank For Your Needs Abroad:</p></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Monthly service fees</p></li>\n<li><p>Minimum account balance</p></li>\n<li><p>Overdraft protection fees</p></li>\n<li><p>Interest earnings</p></li>\n<li><p>Foreign ATM Fee reimbursement</p></li>\n<li><p>Options for depositing money</p></li>\n<li><p>Quality of customer service</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Charles Schwab Bank has easily checked these boxes for us so far.
