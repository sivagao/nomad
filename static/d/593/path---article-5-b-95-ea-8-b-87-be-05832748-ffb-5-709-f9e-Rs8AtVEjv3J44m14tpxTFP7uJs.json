The region isn&#8217;t cheap, and there are only a couple of hostels between the five towns. My suggested place is:</p><p>If you want to find more hostel options, you need to stay in nearby La Spezia.</p><p><strong>Budget hotel prices</strong> &#8211; A night in a 2-star budget hotel in a room that sleeps two starts around 60 EUR (expect to pay 20 EUR more in the high season). Included in this price are basic hotel amenities, like a private bathroom, free WiFi, and television. Some offer free breakfast. For the most options, stay in Monterosso. On Airbnb, you can find shared rooms starting around 25 EUR per night and entire apartments starting around 55 EUR per night.</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; Cinque Terre is an expensive place to eat. Generally, restaurant meals cost between 25-35 EUR for a meal with drinks. Most restaurants open for lunch, close for their siesta, then open again around 7pm for dinner.  At most restaurants, add 3 EUR for the &#8220;coperto&#8221; (sit down fee) that covers service and the bread at the table. You can get cheap wine at the store for around 5 EUR a bottle and pizza, paninis, or my favorite focaccia for 4 EUR, and a whole pizza for 12 EUR. With these kinds of amazing local ingredients to work with, a picnic on the coast is one of my favorite ways to eat in the region. If you&#8217;re feeling ambitious and staying somewhere with a kitchen, consider cooking your own food. You&#8217;ll pay about 60 EUR per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods. If you find a discount grocer like Eurospin, In&#8217;s Mercato, LD Market, Lidl or Penny Market, you&#8217;ll pay a lot less.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; Cinque Terre has several ways to get around. There is a system of walking and hiking trails that connect all of the towns that are my first choice &#8211; trails vary in difficulty, so bring your sturdy shoes! A train also link the towns. If you&#8217;re going between all five, purchase a Cinque Terre Card (17 EUR for the day). This card grants unlimited access to the trains, buses, and the footpath that connects the villages for a day. I love to hike between the five towns, and then take the train back to my accommodation for a rest! If you decide to ride the train, make sure you get a ticket because they are serious about checking and give hefty fines.</p></div>","title":"Cinque Terre Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea8b87be05832748ffb5"}}
