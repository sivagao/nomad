Fire shows and Thai boxing matches are a regular occurrence at the beach bars. Often times, there are massive beach parties. For live music, make your way to the fantastically named Rolling Stoned Bar. Partying is not cheap here and is one of the reasons people end up spending too much money here!</p><h5>2. Dive the King Cruiser Wreck</h5><p>One of the best dive sites off Ko Phi Phi is the King Cruiser wreck. The passenger ship sunk in 1997 when it hit the Anemone reef. This site is packed with fish including clown fish, tuna and barracuda, not to mention the sea anemones that cling to every surface of the reef.  Keep an eye out for the occasional leopard shark.</p><h5>3. Check out Thai Boxing</h5><p>The Reggae Bar offers Thai boxing nightly. You can get big buckets of booze, and if you are in the mood you can even get out in the ring yourself. Winners receive free buckets for their tables! Some local matches are schedule, and if you are lucky, you&#8217;ll find some high-stakes fights with professionals brought in. The bar also has large screen TVs that show a range of sports.</p><h5>4. Hang out on Monkey Beach</h5><p>Monkey Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Thailand, not just Ko Phi Phi.
