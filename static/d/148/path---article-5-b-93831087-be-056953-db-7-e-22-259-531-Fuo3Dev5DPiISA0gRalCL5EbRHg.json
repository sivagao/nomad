We&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-coinbase-ships-product-64a902a7b187#.j32f3lbrg\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">gotten a lot done</a> and kept a high bar over the past three years.</p><p name=\"bd8c\" id=\"bd8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But in the past year we&#8217;ve had a few engineers who needed to move (due to various life events). We didn&#8217;t want to lose them, so they became remote employees on our team. In some cases it worked really well.</p><p name=\"fb22\" id=\"fb22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This caused us to reconsider the idea of remote engineers and we&#8217;ve decided to reach out to a wider pool of applicants around the world.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RY5safzX5ZS3rvm0px5joA.jpeg\">Working with remote engineers has gotten easier with large televisions and Google Hangouts in every conference room.<h4 name=\"b4dd\" id=\"b4dd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Success Factors For Remote Engineers</h4><p name=\"6c98\" id=\"6c98\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">We don&#8217;t have a ton of experience with this yet, but here are a few factors we&#8217;ve noticed that seemed to help:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"4c6c\" id=\"4c6c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Intrinsic Motivation</strong>&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Some people are self-starters and get a lot done when left alone. These traits seem to be key vs people who need more direction, are motivated by external factors, or thrive on human interaction.</li><li name=\"c3c3\" id=\"c3c3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">High Bandwidth Communication&#8202;</strong>&#8212;&#8202;Some people speak and write succinctly (outbound communication) and understand what you mean right away (inbound communication). Without access to the same ad-hoc communication that happens in HQ, remote engineers need to be excellent in both written and verbal communication.</li><li name=\"ce3e\" id=\"ce3e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Relatively Close Time Zones&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;</strong>We experienced a few challenges when time zones of remote engineers were vastly different. Being able to attend key meetings like Monday standups or Friday all hands seems to help.</li><li name=\"40da\" id=\"40da\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Time With Us In HQ&#8202;</strong>&#8212;&#8202;Engineers who were the most successful had spent at least some time with us in HQ.</li></ul><h4 name=\"08bd\" id=\"08bd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">Who We&#8217;re Looking&#160;For</h4><p name=\"9010\" id=\"9010\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">We&#8217;re looking for people with some work experience who have great communication skills, and have either tried remote work before or feel they might enjoy it.</p><p name=\"2ee6\" id=\"2ee6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you have a passion for bitcoin, a computer science degree, or experience with one of the languages we use the most (ruby, node.js), these are all nice to have but not required.</p><p name=\"78b5\" id=\"78b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If hired, we plan to fly you out for a week or two every quarter to spend some in-person time in San Francisco. You will also attend regular meetings (Monday standup, Friday all hands) and go through the same hiring process that in house engineers go through, including an on site work trial.</p><h4 name=\"3c0d\" id=\"3c0d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">How To&#160;Apply</h4><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/careers/137754\" class=\"graf-imageAnchor\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pks-wTyTdZm8__Nvbk4E_A.png\"></a>Interested in working with us? Send us a&#160;note.<p name=\"5699\" id=\"5699\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you&#8217;re interested in speaking with us about a role we&#8217;ve set up a <a href=\"http://hr.gs/cb-eng-challenge\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">coding challenge</strong></a> that you can take in about 30&#8211;45 minutes to show us your skills.
