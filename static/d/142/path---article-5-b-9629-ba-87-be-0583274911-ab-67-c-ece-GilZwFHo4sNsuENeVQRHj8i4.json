I was leaving my friends, school and what I thought was my whole life behind. At 15 years old it&#8217;s easy to be dramatic!</p><p>After a few years I fell in love with Merseyside and Liverpool in particular. Everything from the charm and humor of the people, to the extensive maritime history and UNESCO World Heritage Waterfront.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><p>&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJdpaIvjeTc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A photo posted by Jess Buck|JourneyswithJessica (@jessica16_x)</a> on Aug 23, 2016 at 12:38pm PDT</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Liverpool is also responsible for breeding some legendary creative talents, there&#8217;s The Beatles, Cilla Black icons of British music as well as more current acts such as The Wombats and The Hummingbirds. It&#8217;s easy to see how the city earned its UNESCO City of Music Status.</p><p><strong>What makes Liverpool a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</strong></p><p>Before living in Liverpool my understanding of the city was tracksuits, perms and mustaches thanks to the Fast Show. That particular stereotype is long gone from the cosmopolitan streets that make up todays vibrant city centre.</p><p>There are trendy independent districts like Bold Street and the Rope Walks. Albert Dock boasts an art gallery, museums and chic water side cocktail bars. There are endless rows of designer and high street stores. Liverpool One even has its own park bordered by an outdoor terrace and top brand chain restaurants.</p><p><strong>What 5 star hotel is the best in Liverpool?</strong></p><p>To be honest the 5 star hotels that are genuinely rated at 5 stars are nothing to brag about in Liverpool. There&#8217;s the usual Hilton and the Radisson but nowhere I would choose to say is the best. This may be due to my taste for the quirkiness but I believe if you want to enjoy your evening and like a taste of luxury the 4-star hotel Hard Days Night is perfect to get a taste of what Liverpool is all about. Click <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Hard_Days_Night_Hotel.htm\">here</a> for rates and availability.&#160;</p><p>The superb suites here, in particular the Lennon suite is completely white and a gleaming white grand piano in the centre of the suite. Even though not a 5 star rating this place gets a thumbs up in my book, and gives guests a taste of Beatle&#8217;s history to be experienced nowhere else in Liverpool.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18258\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/30JS.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Liverpool\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></p><p><strong>What about boutique hotels in Liverpool, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</strong></p><p>Having stayed in plenty of quirky hotels in my time I would say that the quirkier the better when it comes to boutique hotels. None in my mind beat <strong>30 James Street -Home of the Titanic</strong>. The individual d&#233;cor of each floor, themed around either the RMS Titanic, its passengers or its intended destination New York is astounding. In particular the first two floors of the hotel are clad completely in cushioned black leather. The rooms match this and behind each leather clad door guests will chic styling from the opulent furniture and lighting to the decadent marbled bathrooms. Click <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/30_James_Street.htm\">here</a> for rates and availability.&#160;</p><p>I have stayed on numerous occasions and will always venture back there when avoiding a taxi fare home. I&#8217;ve even spoiled members of my family with all-inclusive dinner and accommodation offers, as the hotel also boasts a rooftop restaurant and cocktail bar The Carpathia. It honestly doesn&#8217;t get more glamorous than enjoying a cocktail a rooftop terrace whilst watching the starlight twinkling off the waters in the Albert Dock.</p><p><strong>Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Liverpool?</strong></p><p>Perhaps not considered luxurious but defiantly an adventure to be had at Industry.1, Liverpool&#8217;s Wake Park.</p><p>Here you can learn to wakeboard before being towed down the Mersey at high speeds on a rubber ring. You&#8217;ll definitely get you hair wet but it&#8217;ll be worth it.</p><p><strong>Where are the best hang outs during the day in Liverpool?</strong></p><p>Making sure you get the most of Liverpool is easy as the city that is very compact and user friendly. You can see all the major tourist attractions in a day.</p><p>That being said, on top of the museums and art galleries Liverpool is also home to one of the most stunning Victorian parks in England, Sefton Park. Here you could spend a day lounging in the sun or strolling around the Palm House which was once home to the rare and tropical plants imported from far off lands.</p><p>If that doesn&#8217;t keep you busy all day then Lark Lane is a popular street worth a visit for some quirky boutique shops and top quality cuisines. A favorite of mine on Lark Lane is the Chili Banana, a superb spot to enjoy some amazing Thai cuisine and with a service to match. The best bit you have to try is the restaurants namesake a Chili Banana which is literally a banana fritter in sweet but hot chili sauce. Delicious.</p><p><strong>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Liverpool and what are their best dishes?</strong></p><p>My date nights usually consist of trying the newest place in Liverpool. As I&#8217;ve been everywhere else, literally. If I were to choose my all-time favorite, I&#8217;d struggle between three.</p><p>Luche Libre offers great Mexican dishes with amazing cocktails and a wonderful service with a smile. The d&#233;cor is rustic with plastic baskets and paper wrapped burritos on the menu. Great for spicing up any date night. My favorite dish is the fish&#160;tacos, something a little different that is quite light so you can load up on nachos spicy rice and wedges.</p><p>For a real romantic setting I love the Italian Fish club at the top of Bold Street. Here the specialty is Italian style seafood, the best risotto I&#8217;ve ever eaten. My partner enjoyed their sea bass served with a samphire side smothered in a delicious garlic oil. There isn&#8217;t a thing on the menu I wouldn&#8217;t eat again. I&#8217;ve yet to try the sister restaurant simply named The Italian Club, but I imagine the service and food is similar.</p><p>Finally, quite possibly the greatest Indian meal of my life was served in the Spice Lounge on Albert Dock. This amazing venue provides diners with the perfect ambiance from which to enjoy a thoroughly modern Indian meal. I enjoyed a delicious marinated lamb dish that was succulent and mouthwatering. What really makes this venue is the location, set against the historical Albert Dock dimly lit with a blue hue from the aquarium lights. A charmingly romantic and utterly stylish night out.</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</strong></p><p>Liverpool&#8217;s sweet tooth craving are answered by a whole host of bakeries, deli&#8217;s and more recently luxury indulgent milkshake venues. My particular favorite guaranteeing sweet tooth satisfaction is Barley and Beans peanut butter freak shake topped with curly whirly, chocolate eclairs, a tiny cupcake a flap jack and lashings of whipped cream.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><p>&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BGbVh35sj7I/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A photo posted by Barley and Beans Liverpool (@barleyandbeans)</a> on Jun 9, 2016 at 1:32am PDT</p></blockquote><p><br> <strong>Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Liverpool who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?&#160;</strong></p><p>Every shopper loves a trip to Liverpool, whether you&#8217;re after that one of a kind designer find or something quirky and classically vintage there is a shop for you in Liverpool.</p><p>The Met Quarter on Whitechapel boasts big brands like Armani, Hugo Boss and All Saints. As well as being home to MAC makeup and Jo Malone, here is defiantly where a girl can indulge in her expensive side.</p><p>There&#8217;s a huge area known as Liverpool one that is home to all the major high street brands as well as the odd high end name such as Michael Kors, Reiss and Radley.</p><p>If you fancy a little something different, try and get your hands on that one of kind designer vintage find on Bold Street where there are a number of boutiques selling high quality and great value vintage designer pieces.</p><p>Heading to Liverpool for a shop be sure to bring an empty suitcase and an extra set of carrying arms.</p><p><strong>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Liverpool?</strong></p><p>There is nothing more important to a Liverpool lady than their hair and make-up. Luckily there is an amazing business that perfectly caters for groups of ladies looking to get glammed up for an evening on the town.</p><p>Peaches and Cream are an independent make up studio in the city centre who provide ladies with a VIP style service. No matter what your age or occasion the team at Peaches and Cream will leave you feeling like a star.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18259\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MORGANS-SPA.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Liverpool\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p>Definitely worth a visit is Morgan&#8217;s Spa. This Liverpool hotel spa offers its visitors a chance to enjoy a host of amazing treatments from massages and facials to body contouring and champagne wraps. The spa itself is located in the depths of what was once the offices of the White Star Line the firm responsible for registering the RMS Titanic to sail. Hence the theme of the hotel and spa being based on the ill-fated</p><p>Not only is Morgan&#8217;s Spa a fabulous retreat from the city it is also a chance to see inside a building with such and iconic reputation. Combine all this with a 40sqft hydrotherapy pool and you have the best spa experience in Liverpool.</p><p><strong>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</strong></p><p>Depending on what I was aiming to do during the time the sun is setting, there are only two places I would recommend.</p><p>If you were hoping to enjoy a sunset meal, then Matou on the river front is the ideal choice. The delightful Pan Asian Restaurant and Bar offer diners a floor to ceiling view across the Mersey. My meal of choice here that perfectly complements the scenery is the Three Delicacies in White Wine Sauce washed down with a Chili and passionfruit martini. Superb!</p><p>If you&#8217;ve already eaten, then a trip not to miss in the summer is an evening cruise across the Mersey on the world famous Mersey Ferry. Sailors are treated to spectacular views across the river as well as a unique perspective of the Three Graces bathe din the golden glow of the setting sun.</p><p><strong>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot.</strong></p><p>My number one choice for pre-gaming drinks is Alma De Cuba. The exterior of the building is enough to get your glamour radar beeping. The venue is a former church which has been converted into a most chic and elegant cocktail bar and restaurant.</p><p>On the upper terrace visitors can enjoy a fabulous meal in stylish surroundings then descend into the lower floor to begin their evening with a great choice of premium drinks.</p><p>There is a certain decadence that comes hand in hand with the fiery Latino theme. Think ladies in feather headdresses and refreshing minty mojitos all coming together to provide a taste of southern American culture with a tropical Caribbean twist.</p><p><strong>If you end the night at a fancy club in Liverpool, which one do you head towards?</strong></p><p>The newest most exclusive VIP bar to open in Liverpool is Noctua. Located on Stanley Street next door to designer shopping mall the Met Quarter, Noctua has already welcomed some local and out of town celebrities and is the number one place to be seen in Liverpool.</p><p>A member only access club that can be arranged prior to your visit guarantees a great mix of likeminded individuals all looking for a high-class night out. Drinks are off the highest quality as is the music and staff service.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18256 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ME.jpg?resize=96%2C128&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"ME\" width=\"96\" height=\"128\">I&#8217;m a lovely young lady who takes inspiration from all the wonderful things in life, fashion, art, photography, nature, then shares them with the world.&#160;Hardworking and passionate in everything she does hoping one day to make a memorable mark on the world.&#160;With a new blog at <a href=\"http://fromthebowery.wordpress.com\">fromthebowery.wordpress.com</a> and career in digital marketing I&#8217;m always looking for the next beautiful thing.
