Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to Queenstown</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in Queenstown.</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;m Petra, and I&#8217;m one half of <a href=\"http://theglobalcouple.com\">The Global Couple</a> travel blog (the other half is my husband Shaun). We have travelled to many parts of the world and have settled back in our home country of New Zealand (for now!). Queenstown is in New Zealand&#8217;s South Island. We have visited the town many times over the past few years, and we have tried out many luxury options that Queenstown has to offer!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11466\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown6.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes Queenstown a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Queenstown has so much to offer luxury-oriented travelers. It&#8217;s a pretty expensive city to visit and as New Zealand&#8217;s tourism hub many companies catering to the luxury traveler have sprung up. There are 5-star hotels, amazing fine dining restaurants, spas, and many activities to keep you busy.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11462\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown2.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in your town?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We&#8217;ve stayed at <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Hilton_Queenstown_Resort_Spa.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Hilton</a> which is about 10 minutes&#8217; drive out of Queenstown, but it is in a lovely setting right next to the lake. They even have jet boats to take you from the hotel to town and back again if you don&#8217;t want to drive!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/https://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Blanket_Bay.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blanket Bay</a>, about 45 minutes&#8217; drive from Queenstown in the small town of Glenorchy, is one of New Zealand&#8217;s top luxury hotels. It&#8217;s got a hefty price tag but from what we hear it&#8217;s an incredible place to stay.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11461\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"> </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">There are so many fun activities to do in Queenstown that it would take forever to list them all! One of the best activities we have done (and highly recommend) is a scenic flight to Milford Sound. The mountainous landscape surrounding Queenstown make it an ideal place to do a scenic flight &#8211; the views are just breathtaking. Landing at <strong>Milford Sound and doing a boat cruise</strong> is like being transported to another world. There are also jet boat tours, and the vineyard scene around Queenstown is great too &#8211; there are guided tours so that you can drink and don&#8217;t have to drive! Check out this article on <a href=\"http://www.theglobalcouple.com/36-hours-queenstown-new-zealand/\">36 hours in Queenstown</a> for more ideas of activities and places to go!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Sitting on the lakefront in a caf&#233; or bar is one of our favourite things to do in Queenstown. With the mountains all around and a great coffee in hand it&#8217;s not hard to feel happy! Queenstown Gardens are right next to the town and are worth a walk around too.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11464\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown4.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11465\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown5.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in&#160;Queenstown&#160;and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">We recently visited<strong> Madam Woo,</strong> on Mall St in Queenstown. This restaurant serves amazing Malaysian fusion food &#8211; our favourite dishes were the beef rendang curry and the pork hawker roll &#8211; kind of like a Malaysian-style taco! For a more fancy dinner, head to <strong>Botswana Butchery</strong> on the lakefront. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Patagonia Chocolates</strong> on Beach Street has a huge selection of ice cream and gelato, as well as dessert dishes. Their hot chocolate is to die for!</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11463\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown3.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Queenstown?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Onsen Hot Pools,</strong> about 10 minutes out of Queenstown, have private spa pools overlooking the beautiful Shotover River. You can hire the pools by the hour and you can add on extras like champagne and candles &#8211; it&#8217;s such a fun and relaxing experience! There are massage and spa services in all the good hotels in Queenstown. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Anywhere along the lake front has beautiful sunset views. You can also catch the <strong>Skyline Gondola</strong> up to the top of the hill above Queenstown for some excellent views over the town, lake, and surrounding mountains.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11467\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown7.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11468\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/luxury-guide-to-queenstown8.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to queenstown new zealand\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">There is a multitude of bars in Queenstown &#8211; there are so many travelers around that every night is party night! We love <strong>Bardeaux,</strong> it&#8217;s tucked away down a lane and it serves a wide range of whiskies and other spirits as well as renowned local wine.</p><p>(click to book a room or book a flight)</p><p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11081 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/10733725_1499287673693100_5145748702056868803_o.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"packing tips from the global couple\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\">Petra is one half of <a href=\"http://t.sidekickopen08.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XYg65jFx6W8q5MpC2mSmnjF7XN73Qw_P4f37Z7rl03?t=http%3A%2F%2Ftheglobalcouple.com%2F&amp;si=6571274507124736&amp;pi=1715c03b-b9c7-4bef-8f05-dec24bf661d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Global Couple</a> travel blog &#8211; the other half is her husband Shaun.
