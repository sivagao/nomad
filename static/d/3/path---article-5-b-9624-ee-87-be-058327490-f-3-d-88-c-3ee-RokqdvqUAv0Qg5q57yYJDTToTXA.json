To help further protect your privacy and <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/category/travel/security/\">security</a> online, all connections to <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com\">foXnoMad</a> are now using TLS encryption. This means, among other things, your comments (along with the information you send with them, like email addresses) won&#8217;t be visible to anyone potentially watching the wireless network you&#8217;re on. Switching to full encryption is a move sites like <a href=\"https://search.googleblog.com/2012/03/bringing-more-secure-search-around.html\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/secure-browsing-by-default/10151590414803920/\">Facebook</a> have made and it was about time I did here too.</p>\n<p>Sites using SSL/TLS do give you some privacy on wireless networks but to be completely secure, you should be using one of these <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2015/09/08/the-3-best-vpns-for-frequent-travelers/\">VPNs for travelers</a>. For foXnoMad, you shouldn&#8217;t notice any major differences from the change (except a little lock icon in your browser bar) but if you do come across any weirdness, I would appreciate if you could please let me know in the comments below.
