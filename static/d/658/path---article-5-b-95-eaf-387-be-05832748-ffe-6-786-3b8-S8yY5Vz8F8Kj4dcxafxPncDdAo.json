I&#8217;d come back, stay for a few weeks, and do it all over again.</p><p>I&#8217;d be able to balance my twin desires: settling down and my love of travel.</p><p>But I was na&#239;ve.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/solo-travel-end/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Since moving here in January</a>, I never managed to spend more than a couple weeks in New York City before having to leave again. When I moved into my own apartment in July, I left the next day. I came back for a week before leaving again for two months.</p><p>I never got to settle down.</p><p>I never took those cooking classes.</p><p>I never joined that gym.</p><p>My apartment is still bare, with curtainless windows, books longing for a bookcase, and walls lacking&#160;art and paintings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/this-is-where-my-story-ends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The famed &#8212; and much desired &#8212; end to my travels</a> never really materialized, as I&#8217;ve spent much of the last year on the road.</p><p>&#8220;I thought you were slowing down,&#8221; people would say to me.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying. I&#8217;m trying,&#8221; I&#8217;d reply.</p><p>No matter how hard I tried, slowing down never seemed to happen.&#160;<a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-settled-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">There were, though, many false starts.</a></p><p>But last month while in Europe, I began to feel really homesick. I was tired of traveling and just wanted to be home in my comfy bed.</p><p>I realized I was tired of delaying my roots.</p><p>Roots, after all, can only take hold if they&#8217;re in the ground. I&#8217;ve been trying to develop habits and routines without giving my roots time to grow. I keep uprooting them and then trying to replant them in hopes they&#8217;ll grow.</p><p>But it doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p><p>You need to till the earth, plant the seed, and let the roots take hold.</p><p>You can&#8217;t uproot them.</p><p>It&#8217;s time I give my roots a chance.</p><p>I&#8217;m tired of saying &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll do it next time.&#8221; So I&#8217;m not traveling until the end of December when I go to the Philippines.&#160;There&#8217;s a lot to do in NYC, and it&#8217;s finally time to do it.</p><p>I&#8217;ve purposely filled my schedule with things that will keep me in the city. This week I joined a gym, got a trainer, and paid for a desk at a co-working space.&#160;I&#8217;m having friends visit.</p><p>I&#8217;m here.&#160;I&#8217;m home.</p><p>It&#8217;s time to grow some roots.</p><p>Nothing will stop me now.</p><p><strong>Related articles:</strong></p><h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4><p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br> Find a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"http://track.webgains.com/click.html?wglinkid=701003&amp;wgcampaignid=176915\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Momondo</a>.
