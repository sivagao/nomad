I&#8217;m Chantae, a travel writer who has been based in Perth, Western Australia for the past three years. I&#8217;m obsessed with finding the best of everything that Perth has to offer &#8211; and this includes luxury travel. Though I usually live a pretty simple lifestyle filled with beach days and eating at home, I love to take visitors to more high-end places and often splurge for celebrations. You can find <a href=\"http://www.chantae.com/category/australia-2/western-australia-australia-2/\">everything you want to know about Western Australia</a> on my blog at <a href=\"http://www.chantae.com\">Chantae.com</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes Perth a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Perth apparently has the highest number of self-made millionaires in the world. When the mining boom hit, a demand for luxurious resorts, events, and restaurants followed as people adjusted to a more inflated lifestyle. So, there are a ton of options when it comes to luxury to-dos.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16849\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CoupDvent28.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Perth\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in </i></b><b><i>Perth</i></b><b><i>?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://tidd.ly/8ead3b55\"><strong>The Richardson Hotel and Spa</strong></a> is a boutique, five-star hotel near downtown, King&#8217;s Park, and the trendy neighborhood of Subiaco. If you&#8217;re someone who loves to be in the middle of it all, near public transport and a short drive from the beach, then this is the perfect place for you. The hotel also has a spa, indoor pool, and trendy bars in house. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels in Perth, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://tidd.ly/e4a19046\"><strong>Sunmoon Boutique Resort</strong></a> in Scarborough Beach is a cute and reasonably priced hotel in an awesome location. It&#8217;s just behind the Rendezvous Hotel, a massive hotel with a little less personality. Both are located right near the beach and walking distance to cafes, organic food shops, boutique shops, and the ocean. It&#8217;s the perfect place to be if you&#8217;re looking to relax and stay somewhere you won&#8217;t have to leave for the duration of your stay. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun luxury activities for the adventurous traveler in Perth?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">There are so many fun luxurious adventure activities around Perth, it&#8217;s crazy. You can join a whale watching tour or take a chartered yacht to Rottnest Island for surfing, scuba diving, and sightseeing. <a href=\"http://www.chantae.com/penguin-island-paradise-pengos-tyrannical-seagull-hell/\">(Think twice about visiting Penguin Island!)</a> Three hours south of Perth is Margaret River, where you can spend half of the day on a gourmet food wine tasting tour, and the other half of the day learning how to surf, kayak, and mountain bike.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16851\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fremantle.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Perth\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day in Perth?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Scarborough Beach has the most to offer with a white sand beach perfect for swimming and lounging, nearby restaurants, and shops. You can easily pack a sarong and spend the day there without getting bored. On the weekends, there are often free salsa dancing lessons or live performances in the amphitheater. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Perth</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Il Lido is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Cottesloe Beach. A perfect date night includes grabbing a glass of wine and watching the sunset from the Ocean Beach Hotel, and then walking to Il Lido for delicious potato gnocchi. Locals love the ribs and views from Scarborough Beach Bar &#8211; personally, I like to go for the pumpkin salad. Coco&#8217;s is also a favorite place of mine, an upscale venue in South Perth with views of downtown Perth known for its seafood and prime beef.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16852\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0100.jpg?resize=420%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Perth\" width=\"420\" height=\"560\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Greens and Co. in Leederville is practically synonymous for coffee and cake in Perth. The atmosphere is filled with funky paper lanterns, old posters, cushy couches, and hosts a variety of games. The cakes offered change on a rotating basis, so what you see is what you get!</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us all the hot shopping spots in Perth; who&#8217;s carrying the trendy local designers?&#160;</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">If you love quirky boutique shops, head to Hillary&#8217;s Boat Harbour, a shopping center with unique storefronts set to a backdrop of multimillion dollar yachts. Keep an eye out for sweet swimwear designers like Gypsea, Nu Swimwear, PALM Swimwear, and more. Western Australia is also known for its pearls, which you can pick up at the Kailis store downtown or in Fremantle. Someone to meet is Natalie Rolt, an inspiring local who took her love of fashion first to the marketplace and now has a shop in Fremantle.</p><p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;m also obsessed with Lydianne from <a href=\"http://www.coupdvent.com\">Coup D&#8217;vent</a>, who creates cute purses out of recycled kitesurfing kites.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16854\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Scarborough-Beach.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Perth\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Perth?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Thirty minutes outside of Perth, in a forest, is the Hidden Valley Spa &#8211; perfect for relaxing with friends for the day. Also, don&#8217;t underestimate the Crown Casino that also has a day spa in house with talented masseuses! Friends also rave about Keturah Spa, a small chain that has locations all throughout Perth. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re a fan of skylines, be sure to pack a picnic and head to the top of Kings Park for a prime view of the city lights. If you&#8217;re more of a beach bunny, opt for taking a picnic down to either Cottesloe or Trigg for stunning views of Western Australia&#8217;s cloudscapes that create surreal sunsets. </p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">For something unique and fun, I love to join a Rivercat Cruise that serves drinks on a small boat that takes you along the Swan River. It&#8217;s located in downtown Perth, so once you&#8217;re done there, it&#8217;s great to head into the city and carry onward.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16850\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CoupDvent35.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Perth\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you end the night at a fancy club in Perth, which one do you head towards? </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The Brena Bar recently came under fire by having a &#8220;No Plebeians&#8221; policy, citing it only welcomes people dressed to the nines into its venue. Though that&#8217;s not really my style, I always have a great time sipping a few drinks at The Breakwater in Hillarys Boat Harbour, The Crown Perth near Victoria Park, or the Conservatory Rooftop Bar on Murray Street.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16848 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chantae-reden-travel-writer.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"chantae-reden-travel-writer\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Chantae Reden is a travel writer obsessed with all things adventure and new experiences.
