Don&#8217;t misunderstand, I absolutely love traveling, but I hate not working. So much so that somehow over the last 3 years I turned my vacation into a job. Before that as a full time hacker (no, I didn&#8217;t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask\">wear these</a> but wish I had) aka. computer security consultant, I worked as hard as a played. If you&#8217;ve ever had drinks with me, then you really know how much hard work that means.</p>\n<p>So, nothing big, no drama, I&#8217;m just going to be a good boss to my best &#8211; and only &#8211; employee. Me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give myself 6 weeks of annual vacation and force myself to use it. Plus 2-weeks of oh-crap twisted ankle, fist fight with a shady taxi driver (happens occasionally), or recruited as a solider in an interstellar war between good and evil (happens even more occasionally)&#8230;sick leave. Though usually I can knock out a cheating taxi driver while hopping on one foot plus stop any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith\">Sith Lord</a> from destroying the balance of the force in less time than that. In other words, I probably won&#8217;t use all of that extra two weeks. But we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p><strong>So What Happens Here When I&#8217;m Gone?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing. More specifically I&#8217;ll make a note here letting you know I&#8217;m going to be gone for one, two, whatever weeks. During those times I won&#8217;t respond to most emails, write new posts, and be very slow on getting back to your comments. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/foXnoMad.travel\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/foxnomad\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"http://foxnomad.tumblr.com/\">tumblr</a> will probably be quieter too. Chances are my first break will be coming up after my February 2nd live chat with <a href=\"http://www.uncorneredmarket.com/\">Uncornered Market</a> right before I kick off that <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2011/04/05/the-best-city-to-visit-travel-tournament-2011-winner-is-porto-portugal/\">annual contest we all love</a> so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Why The Breaks?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written over 2,100 articles here, on <a href=\"http://howtotravelwithpets.com/\">my</a> <a href=\"http://travelblogadvice.com/\">other</a> <a href=\"http://techguidefortravel.com/\">sites</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/about/press/\">elsewhere</a> &#8211; receive and respond to over a <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2011/06/24/blow-out-the-candles-foxnomad-turns-5-years-old-today/\">hundred emails most days</a> &#8211; and am in front of some gadget working more than 50 hours most weeks. Oh, yeah, and traveling, <a href=\"http://photos.foxnomad.com/\">photographing</a>, and <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2012/01/03/the-best-comments-of-december-2011-and-live-chat-from-cruise-ships-to-kabul-with-long-term-traveler-wandering-earl/\">meeting up with you</a> fine folks all over the world too. The occasional short break will give me a chance to indulge my other passions and recharge the 1.3 kilo lump of fat sitting in my skull. I believe resulting in better quality and interesting words for you to read in the long run.</p>\n<p>&#8230;and surprises.</p>\n<p>Plus you&#8217;ll get a little reading break too from time to time, so no need to feel left out.</p>\n<p>As always thank you and happy traveling.<br>\nTravel smarter,<br>\n-Anil</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"You Can’t Have All The Fun: I’m Giving Myself Some Vacation Time"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9624db87be058327490f23"}}
