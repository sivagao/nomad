I&#8217;ve bought a bed. I&#8217;ve unpacked my bag, hung up my clothes, and filled my fridge with food. I&#8217;m settled. I have roots. I have a neighborhood.</p><p><a href=\"https://nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/solo-travel-end/\">I&#8217;m no longer fully nomadic</a>.</p><p>Am I at least semi-nomadic? I don&#8217;t even know.</p><p>People keep asking me when my next trip is.&#160;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I tell them.</p><p>I&#8217;m currently on my book tour until April and then will be in Europe in May.</p><p>But since these are work related, I don&#8217;t view them as real &#8220;for pleasure&#8221; travel.</p><p>It&#8217;s a weird feeling not having anything planned. For the first time in years, I have no idea where or when I&#8217;m going next.</p><p>All these trip ideas keep popping in and out of my head.</p><p>Then I look at my schedule and think&#160;When will I have time to go to these places? When did I become such a grown-up with an actual schedule?</p><p>Maybe it&#8217;s good, though. I can slowly adjust to not being constantly on the road.</p><p>It hasn&#8217;t been as hard as I thought. I haven&#8217;t had the desire to sprint to JFK and board the next flight. I haven&#8217;t become antsy.</p><p>The hardest part has been developing a routine, in part because I&#8217;m here, then there, and then here again. I&#8217;m eating better (though the pizza place next door makes that difficult), but I haven&#8217;t joined a gym. I still haven&#8217;t managed to develop a good work schedule. I find myself working long days because I&#8217;m not doing anything else. I&#8217;m used to having to race around to fit in sightseeing and work at the same time. Now I sit on Facebook, watch my roommate&#8217;s TV, and then wonder, &#8220;Where did the day go?&#8221; because I have nothing to force me to be productive.</p><p>That&#8217;s something I need to work on. <a href=\"https://nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/new-york-city/\">New York City</a> has so much to do that I need to better manage my time, so I don&#8217;t let the days fly by.</p><p>If slowing down has taught me one thing, it&#8217;s that I don&#8217;t like slowing down.</p><p>I need to be busy.</p><p>I need action.</p><p>I need to better manage my time.</p><p>Because I should never waste a day in the city that never sleeps.</p><h3>Get the In-Depth Budget Guide to New York City!</h3><p><a href=\"https://nomadicmatt.com/books/new-york-city-guide/\"><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/GuideBookCovers/NM_Guide_to_NYC_Flat.jpg\" alt=\"NYC travel guide\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\"></a>For more in-depth information and tips on NYC, check out my 100+ page guidebook written for budget travelers like yourself!
