And the funny thing is, they&#8217;re right!</p><h4 name=\"cb6f\" id=\"cb6f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Quick story:</strong></h4><p name=\"6489\" id=\"6489\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The first night I arrived in Thailand, my Airbnb host (Bulan) took me to a tattered street filled with food carts. While the aroma of fresh herbs and spicy chilis enticed my appetite, the ghetto sight of the place terrified me.</p><p name=\"732d\" id=\"732d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Bulan told me not to worry though. Just to prepare my stomach for legit Thai food. But once we placed our order and sat down to chat, her cheery grin suddenly became horrified.</p><p name=\"6c18\" id=\"6c18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Wondering what might&#8217;ve caused her sudden reaction, I turned my head around.</p><p name=\"c121\" id=\"c121\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My eyes locked onto a frail, half-naked man, crawling towards us. Trickles of blood ran down his face, as if he got beaten up by a gang, leaving a gruesome trail behind. He mumbled something in Thai to Bulan and me (I&#8217;m not sure what).</p><p name=\"61cc\" id=\"61cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I turn back to Bulan, confused and deeply disturbed.</p><p name=\"b0ce\" id=\"b0ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Bulan:</strong> Don&#8217;t look at him! I don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s on the floor, but just pretend everything&#8217;s okay.</p><p name=\"0fdd\" id=\"0fdd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Me:</strong> Umm&#8230;.Bulan? Is this what Thailand&#8217;s like?</p><p name=\"d5a0\" id=\"d5a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Bulan:</strong> NO! This is the 1st time I&#8217;ve seen this.</p><p name=\"9389\" id=\"9389\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">*phew*</p><p name=\"17a8\" id=\"17a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For a moment there, I thought I&#8217;d be stuck living indoors for the rest of my time in Thailand. Because no way was I going to put myself at risk, especially when everyone said that Thailand is a dangerous place to travel alone.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZycrCcg247F1r5q5cday3g.jpeg\">The street Bulan took me that first&#160;night.<p name=\"9f0a\" id=\"9f0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The truth is, Thailand is relatively safe to wander about. I stepped out of the house maybe 2&#8211;3 times a day (for work, for food, for shopping), and not once was I harassed, pick-pocketed, or held at knifepoint.</p><p name=\"701c\" id=\"701c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thank god.</p><p name=\"324b\" id=\"324b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As long as you have Google Maps, 500 baht (~$14 USD), and some street sense, you&#8217;ll be fine. Of course, there might be times when your phone dies or you really can&#8217;t find your way.</p><p name=\"7e4e\" id=\"7e4e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So what&#8217;s the next best alternative?</p><p name=\"e7bf\" id=\"e7bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Asking the local people.</strong></p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vnsuhWKjuJYsgFH2ZD-PTw.jpeg\">Thai taxi driver | Photo Credit:&#160;<a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/u/unsplash/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p name=\"9271\" id=\"9271\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Just to let you know, Thais are some of the nicest, most down-to-earth people you&#8217;d ever meet. They generally mind their own business and give you enough personal space to make you feel at ease. But if you need help, they&#8217;ll do everything they can to help out.</p><p name=\"16c8\" id=\"16c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Maybe it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re so used to helping tourists. Or maybe it&#8217;s because 95% of them are Buddhists.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HgMKnJSHIGuT-ROKl1oGTQ.jpeg\">Buddhist monks | Photo Credit:&#160;<a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/u/pixabay/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a><p name=\"0d91\" id=\"0d91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Personally, I believe it&#8217;s because they treat everyone like their own kind.</p><p name=\"e2f9\" id=\"e2f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I remember this one time a local (a security guard at the train station) asked if I was Thai. I shook my head &#8220;no&#8221; and said I was Chinese. Thinking she&#8217;d brush me off as one of those folks, she simply smiled and said I&#8217;d totally pass as a Thai.</p><p name=\"8e12\" id=\"8e12\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s hard to describe what I felt at that moment, but seeing her smile made me feel like I was one of them. A rare feeling as a foreigner.</p><p name=\"2400\" id=\"2400\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s just shocks me how open Thais are to other cultures. Because most people on this world aren&#8217;t&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;they tend to favor and stick to their own kind, where they deeply believe their country is best.</p><p name=\"689e\" id=\"689e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;m not saying Thais have a weaker sense of nationalism and don&#8217;t care as much for their own kind. In fact, they&#8217;re extremely devoted to their country. I remember how their King passed away on October 13, 2016, and the next day, almost every Thai dressed up in black!</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8Ti6CyRZd49Act-tmMN_jw.png\">From what I heard, Thais have to wear black for a month to show respect for their&#160;King.<p name=\"9ee8\" id=\"9ee8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">They even plastered billboard-size pictures of the king on almost every skyscraper. And displayed his portrait inside every mall.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xOOSFJ0Qkn6PgZaggUCqkw.jpeg\">A devoted Thai paying his respects to the King at the MBK shopping&#160;mall.<p name=\"9a35\" id=\"9a35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It&#8217;s just incredible to see the amount of patriotism Thais show. I mean, many have sobbed their hearts out. A few have even flown thousands of miles and waited under the scorching sun, just so they can properly mourn the death of their King.</p><p name=\"a608\" id=\"a608\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A sad day in Thai history. But one where I realized how closely connected Thais are.</p><p name=\"5846\" id=\"5846\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Anyways, enough with the sad stuff. You&#8217;re probably wondering what the Thai lifestyle is like.</p><p name=\"4986\" id=\"4986\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s pretty much the same as the U.S. where people work 9&#8211;5, Monday to Friday, in business suits and skirts.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a52BnAvv8SDcdmyXgzZxLA.jpeg\">Rush hour at 3:30pm | Phloen Chit Road (main&#160;street).<p name=\"9d84\" id=\"9d84\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">But when the sun goes down, people don&#8217;t just go home and flick on the TV. Hundreds, if not thousands, scatter through the streets to:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"2102\" id=\"2102\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Get some real Thai grub&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I&#8217;m talking about the ones cooked on the streets!</li><li name=\"c185\" id=\"c185\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Work up some sweat at the nightclub</li><li name=\"2f9c\" id=\"2f9c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Chill at the bars</li><li name=\"40f3\" id=\"40f3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Shop at Bangkok&#8217;s most modern, multi-story shopping malls</li><li name=\"2635\" id=\"2635\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Get a massage at a nice parlor</li><li name=\"6610\" id=\"6610\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Negotiate at the night markets</li><li name=\"8764\" id=\"8764\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Seek fun time with Thailand&#8217;s beautiful girls</li></ul><p name=\"066b\" id=\"066b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Oh boy, about the last point. I encountered so many incidents where I&#8217;d see a sexy, petite Thai girl (usually in her early 20s) hold hands with a big, beefy Caucasian guy. It&#8217;s pretty common, believe it or not, to see this kind of &#8220;courtship&#8221; in Thailand. Except this would only last a day.</p><p name=\"26cd\" id=\"26cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Think &#8220;Tinder&#8221;&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;except both the guy and girl are straightforward with their intentions.</p><p name=\"b054\" id=\"b054\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The guy would pamper the girl with nice stuff, like ice cream, pastries, little snacks. Buy her clothes. Then treat her to dinner.</p><p name=\"c2f1\" id=\"c2f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In return, the girl would dress up in her best outfit, hold his hand, and be his &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; until the day was over&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;which usually ends when the guy invites her into his room to&#8230;</p><p name=\"7d0a\" id=\"7d0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Well you know what!</p><p name=\"2f08\" id=\"2f08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And then late at night, the more populated streets would be lined up with girls, dressed up in short miniskirts, backless tops, and heels&#160;. Waiting. Just waiting to snatch the right guy who might be interested in them for the night.</p><p name=\"2edf\" id=\"2edf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s an interesting sight, because Asian girls usually come off as passive and shy.</p><p name=\"d387\" id=\"d387\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not these girls though.</p><p name=\"8af8\" id=\"8af8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Thai girls are blunt when it comes to what they want. Which is actually a good thing, because then it saves you the guesswork of knowing what she likes or hates, or how she&#8217;s feeling.</p><h3 name=\"2da6\" id=\"2da6\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Thai food in 3&#160;words</strong></h3></div>","title":"My 4 month Journey in Southeast Asia as a Digital Nomad: Thailand"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937b0187be056953db7d02"}}
