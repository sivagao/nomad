In my case, I live abroad and make money by working remotely for several clients.</p><p name=\"9430\" id=\"9430\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I first read about digital nomads in 2014, while I was still working a desk job. I fantasized about being able to leave the fluorescent fishbowl of my office, go forth into the world, pack minimalistically, and work under palm fronds. Indeed, if you look up anything about digital nomads, you&#8217;ll find blogs with gorgeous pictures of Indonesia and Thailand and young people who somehow are able to travel the world without getting UTIs.</p><p name=\"2f65\" id=\"2f65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Meanwhile, like @cuisine_etcetera, we&#8217;re stuck in front of a computer in someone else&#8217;s office, Googling how late we can wait before we have to freeze our eggs. (PS: Not very long, I have to make that decision soon).</p><p name=\"98aa\" id=\"98aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nowadays when I read about how people became digital nomads, I feel like the most popular stories aren&#8217;t the most realistic. I want to give you a month-by-month breakdown of how I went from someone with a full-time job and an employer-sponsored health plan to someone who is:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"ba9c\" id=\"ba9c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Living in Berlin, Germany;</li><li name=\"ae58\" id=\"ae58\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Definitely not making enough money to live full-time yet;</li><li name=\"a71a\" id=\"a71a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Not sure what I&#8217;m going do with my law school loans;</li><li name=\"add2\" id=\"add2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Single;</li><li name=\"e0a9\" id=\"e0a9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">And still Googling how to freeze my eggs.</li></ul><p name=\"c10b\" id=\"c10b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">That is the dream, no?</p><p name=\"7952\" id=\"7952\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because I moved to Germany in March 2017, I&#8217;ll start with March 2016. And here&#8217;s a video version of this story (it&#8217;s a little different):</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><h4 name=\"9454\" id=\"9454\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">March 2016</h4><p name=\"5f04\" id=\"5f04\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The job that I had at the time was a good job but it didn&#8217;t involve any writing. I missed that creative outlet. So in March 2016, I started writing on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Medium\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>. I remember <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessicaguzik/what-did-you-do-this-weekend-and-other-questions-that-will-start-a-revolution-4f9983b5477f?source=user_profile---------97-----------\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">my first story here</strong></a> had five likes&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and I was really excited by those five likes (one of them was definitely my mom).</p><p name=\"2e81\" id=\"2e81\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: Write on Medium, duh.</p><h4 name=\"abe7\" id=\"abe7\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">April 2016</h4><p name=\"c618\" id=\"c618\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As I continued to write on Medium, you could see my interest in digital nomadism creeping into my work. For example I wrote a piece about <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessicaguzik/five-things-you-notice-when-you-become-a-digital-nomad-or-clean-your-room-a5cfb16368c0?source=user_profile---------94-----------\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">whether you should become a digital nomad or clean your room</strong></a>. I was trying to convince myself that I could scratch the itch by cleaning my room. It turns out I was wrong.</p><p name=\"7e3f\" id=\"7e3f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: Suppressed desires can be bellwethers of the future</p><h4 name=\"6715\" id=\"6715\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">May 2016</h4><p name=\"ae6f\" id=\"ae6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In May, I&#8217;ll admit that I coasted. Honestly, I met a guy in a coffee shop whom I was all aflutter about. For a while, I wasn&#8217;t focused on building a writing portfolio or a career that freed me to travel the world. I was back to thinking that maybe living in my hometown of Washington, DC wasn&#8217;t so bad.</p><p name=\"a9f5\" id=\"a9f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: It&#8217;s OK to give yourself a break, even those breaks come unexpectedly and/or in the form of men who surprise you with hyacinths.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*X0vNfp02lqiO01cuufLeSg.jpeg\"><h4 name=\"0d47\" id=\"0d47\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">June 2016</h4><p name=\"ab13\" id=\"ab13\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Guess what happened with Mr. Hyacinth? The flowers outlasted the budding relationship!</p><p name=\"46ee\" id=\"46ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When things ended, I rented a Car2Go, locked myself inside, rolled up the windows, and I screamed as loud as I could. And it felt great! So I screamed as loud as I could three more times.</p><p name=\"3a7e\" id=\"3a7e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was so frustrated: I couldn&#8217;t make relationships work and I wasn&#8217;t sure what I wanted to do professionally in the long run. I felt like I was at a standstill. After I finished screaming, I started fantasizing.</p><blockquote name=\"33f1\" id=\"33f1\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">I asked myself: What am I going after here? What&#8217;s the life that I really&#160;want?</blockquote><p name=\"d68d\" id=\"d68d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">I kept returning to this fantasy of being a digital nomad and traveling more. As part of that, I became interested in co-living. I took a shining to the idea of living in a house in Spain with other entrepreneurs, or small palace a place in Bangkok with a few fellow creatives.</p><p name=\"10fb\" id=\"10fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As I peruse co-living spaces, I discovered <a href=\"http://www.welive.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WeLive</a>. They had just opened a co-living space in Crystal City, Virginia, which is a suburb of Washington DC. But why would I live in a co-living space in Washington DC? It&#8217;s my hometown and I already had a nice one-bedroom apartment. But then I thought, if I&#8217;m all about exploring this lifestyle, then moving into a local co-living community might be a good way to see if I really like living with less stuff and living around lots of people while not giving up my full-time job.</p><p name=\"4840\" id=\"4840\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: Cars really are soundproof!</p><h4 name=\"1b77\" id=\"1b77\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">July 2016</h4><p name=\"dbba\" id=\"dbba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In July I moved into WeLive, and it was fucking awesome!</p><p name=\"9a92\" id=\"9a92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Before I moved, I organized a &#8220;Pillage Party&#8221; to sell all my stuff to friends. One of the coolest things is that now, whenever I visit friends, I get to see parts of my former life in their apartments. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m still connected to them through the stuff that I got rid of.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uiogs3ZJrwb0if-h3MY7FQ.jpeg\"><p name=\"95fa\" id=\"95fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When I started <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessicaguzik/im-31-and-moving-to-an-adult-dorm-here-s-why-670cf13b1b29?source=user_profile---------80-----------\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">writing about WeLive</strong></a>, a particular contact reached out on Twitter and suggested that she and I get drinks. She worked in Crystal City, where WeLive was located, and her job was to promote Crystal City community.</p><p name=\"841f\" id=\"841f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When we got together for drinks, this contact started talking about how she wanted to build Crystal City&#8217;s sense of community through dinner clubs. Well, it turns out that in 2012, I had started <a href=\"http://curatedtable.wordpress.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">a dinner club series designed to foster connections among strangers</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">.</strong></p><p name=\"6770\" id=\"6770\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So I said, &#8220;Well hey, I&#8217;ve done that before.&#8221;</p><p name=\"2872\" id=\"2872\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And she said &#8220;Oh, would you do it in Crystal City?&#8221;</p><p name=\"7ca9\" id=\"7ca9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And I said, &#8220;Uh, would you pay me?&#8221;</p><p name=\"9f74\" id=\"9f74\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And she said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p><p name=\"2d4f\" id=\"2d4f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And I thought: Well, goddamn. I&#8217;m an entrepreneur now!</p><p name=\"3c62\" id=\"3c62\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: Always ask for money!!!!!</p><h4 name=\"a5d8\" id=\"a5d8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">August 2016</h4><p name=\"896b\" id=\"896b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Guess what: I met another boy!</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"8a08\" id=\"8a08\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Once again, I shoved all my interests aside and thought, &#8220;This guy&#8217;s great! Screw traveling, I&#8217;ll just stay here. I can build a nice life&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;I like DC!&#8221; I was still doing Curated Table. I was still writing. But I definitely wasn&#8217;t chomping at the bit to become a digital nomad.</p><p name=\"e542\" id=\"e542\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: It&#8217;s OK to give yourself a break, even those breaks come unexpectedly and/or in the form of men who surprise you with beach vacations.</p><h4 name=\"b321\" id=\"b321\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">September 2016</h4><p name=\"f134\" id=\"f134\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The guy and I split!</p><p name=\"5772\" id=\"5772\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This time I didn&#8217;t scream into a rental car, so that was a step in the right direction. But I did have another soul-searching moment. I had gotten rid of my stuff, I was growing a profitable business, and I was really loving writing. What now?</p><p name=\"9095\" id=\"9095\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At this point I got a bonus from my full-time job. It wasn&#8217;t a huge payload, but it was enough to give me some financial padding to play with.</p><blockquote name=\"df69\" id=\"df69\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">I took a look at my professional, personal, and financial situation and had one thought: I gotta&#160;go.</blockquote><p name=\"407d\" id=\"407d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Lesson: Finances matter. So does luck.</p><h4 name=\"94e2\" id=\"94e2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">October 2016</h4><p name=\"1f3b\" id=\"1f3b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Even though I had made the decision to go, I tortured myself for a month fretting over which direction to take. I was torn because, while my side hustle was going well, I had also always wanted to travel long-term (which by American standards means over one month).</p><p name=\"af03\" id=\"af03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While I was weighing my options, I was not bringing my best self to work. That&#8217;s how I accidentally quit my job. I was having a bad day and my manager asked me about it:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"60d1\" id=\"60d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I just couldn&#8217;t keep it inside anymore. On October 24th, 2016 I quit my full-time job. I have not been full-time employed ever since.</p><p name=\"fb33\" id=\"fb33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: At a certain point, planning is futile. Something in our subconscious will cause us to act (out) when the time is right.</p><h4 name=\"fc6a\" id=\"fc6a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">November 2016</h4><p name=\"d0d3\" id=\"d0d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I finally decided to go full-throttle with my <a href=\"http://www.curatedtable.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">side hustle</strong></a> AND to travel.</p><p name=\"46e5\" id=\"46e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I booked a flight to Paris and back from New Year&#8217;s Eve through Valentine&#8217;s Day. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessicaguzik/my-illustrated-travel-and-eating-itinerary-eab2c4170d9f?source=user_profile---------41-----------\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">My plan</strong></a> was to go to Paris for a couple of days, and then to au pair in Rome for a month.

I was sitting pretty: I had a growing business, an awesome travel plan, and affordable health insurance (thanks, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">The Obama White House</a>!). And then I left.</p><p name=\"ef4a\" id=\"ef4a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Lesson: Enjoy the good times!</p><h4 name=\"40f4\" id=\"40f4\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">January 2017</h4><p name=\"bdf2\" id=\"bdf2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I left for Europe and celebrated an epic New Year&#8217;s Eve in Paris.

I wrestled with the decision, and I eventually decided to leave. I only had seven weeks in Europe (I thought at the time), and I didn&#8217;t want to waste them being miserable. I made arrangements to leave the family, and then to leave Rome. And then my trip took a turn for the amazing.</p></div>","title":"From Desk Jockey to Digital Nomad in One Year – Jessica Guzik – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937ae587be056953db7cea"}}
