Many of the those are big companies that use big, fancy words and have flashy websites complete with photos of their 47 offices in skyscrapers around the world.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not me.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have an office in a skyscraper somewhere, nor a fancy sheepskin hanging on my wall. In fact, I&#8217;m a party school dropout.</p>\n<p>And while my companies are based in Hong Kong, the United States, and across Europe, I divide the majority of my time between the 30 or so countries I visit each year as I constantly optimize my assets in order to &#8220;go where I&#8217;m treated best&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for a bespectacled lawyer with a corner office, I&#8217;m not your man.</p>\n<p><strong>But who is Andrew Henderson?</strong> In a way, I&#8217;m a lot like you.</p>\n<p>I was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1984.</p>\n<p>I grew up going to the summer fair with my grandparents, started reading business books at age 12, and went on to become an Eagle Scout.</p>\n<p>I like working with cat rescue organizations as I travel the world.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s not the kind of stuff you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering, <b>can Andrew Henderson help ME?</b></p>\n<p>Simple answer: maybe.</p>\n<p>While Nomad Capitalist and I have been interviewed or quoted by some of the largest media outlets in the world:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-21267\" src=\"http://nomadcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/as-seen-on-big-nomad-capitalist-reviews-700x267.jpg\" alt='Nomad Capitalist \"As Seen On\"...' width=\"700\" height=\"267\"></p>\n<p>&#8230; that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m the right fit for EVERYONE, or for you.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re here because you found one of my 1,200+ blog posts, or watched one of my 250+ videos, or heard one of my 300+ podcasts. Or perhaps you found me through coverage in the media.</p>\n<p>Either way, the dirty little secret is that most of the four million people who visit Nomad Capitalist every year&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; should NOT be here. More on that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Perhaps like you, I&#8217;m a lifelong entrepreneur. It all started when I dropped out of Arizona State University, I had to find something to do besides sheepishly chatting up girls who came to Arizona to work on their tan.</p>\n<p>So, with little business experience besides helping my father make copies at his office, I started a business of my own.</p>\n<p>Having grown up around the broadcasting industry (my father hosted a talk show alongside his financial services business), I made the ill-advised journey into the radio business.</p>\n<p>As luck would have it, the business turned out to be a success. By age 22 or so, I was making a lot more money than I had ever expected&#8230; and, as it turned out, paying a lot of money in taxes.</p>\n<p>Here I had spent years dreaming of starting a business and making money, yet I never thought about giving close to half of it away in taxes. That&#8217;s the part they don&#8217;t teach you.</p>\n<p>So by the time my business had sales into the eight figures, I finally said &#8220;STOP THE MADNESS!&#8221; and put my own offshore plan into place, reducing my tax rate from 43% to the approximately 1% I paid last year.</p>\n<p>But it wasn&#8217;t so easy&#8230;</p>\n<p>You see, when the money started rolling in, I started traveling. First a little bit, then a little more, then a lot. Within a few years, my business was running on autopilot and I was traveling at least half of the time.</p>\n<p>But I kept paying all of those taxes. And, silly me, I re-invested that money into other businesses in the United States that became profitable and, you guessed it, cost me a lot more in taxes.</p>\n<p>All told, I&#8217;ve paid what financial experts would call &#8220;two bajillion&#8221; dollars in taxes to the IRS, and to other countries as well. That&#8217;s why when I talk to people tired of being a punching bag for the taxman, I actually KNOW the feeling. It&#8217;s personal for me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, by the the time I was 28, I had finally sold everything, from that original radio business to other companies ranging from a swimming pool service, to a car company, to a high-end insurance company.</p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the worst part:</strong> a few years earlier, I had spoken to a tax lawyer &#8211; one of those fancy pants guys I mentioned earlier &#8211; who told me that with all of my traveling, I could pay a heck of a lot less in taxes.</p>\n<p>The only catch was I had to hire him&#8230; for $15,000.</p>\n<p>I literally shouted at the guy. At that time I was in my mid-20s and doing well, but had never paid anyone $15,000 for anything. So I did NOTHING&#8230; and three months later sent another check to the government, one for MUCH MORE than $15,000.</p>\n<p>(As selective as I am in who I work with, I get one or two guys a year who get upset when I ask them to actually pay me for helping them&#8230; and I always remember a younger version of me shouting at that tax lawyer.)</p>\n<p>At the time, the irony didn&#8217;t hit me. It was only later when I realized I could have saved a ton of money by hiring that lawyer to help me did I kick myself.</p>\n<p>But life goes on, and in 2012 I put my home in sunny Arizona up for sale and made the move from &#8220;traveler based in Arizona&#8221; to &#8220;perpetual traveler with no permanent home&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, I traveled to about 90 countries for a few reasons:</p>\n<p>One, spending most of my time outside of the United States meant I could legally avoid paying US taxes on any new business I started.</p>\n<p>Two, I was seeking the best places to park my money. In some cases, that was a bank account in Singapore. In other cases, it was real estate in Cambodia or Hungary. Occasionally, it was even putting some gold bars in a vault.</p>\n<p>Three, traveling the world was an enjoyable way to see other cultures, meet new people, and build a network of experts that have turned out to serve me very well whenever I need them.</p>\n<p><strong>So what about you? There are three kinds of people I CAN&#8217;T help:</strong></p>\n<p>First, if you&#8217;re not willing to move out of your home country at least part-time, I can&#8217;t help you. If you want to spend all of your time in Salt Lake City, or Toronto, or Adelaide, you&#8217;ll have to pay local taxes. Sure, there are some Starbucks-esque tax strategies that could reduce your taxes, but unless you&#8217;re doing $10 million or more a year, it gets messy very quickly.</p>\n<p>Second, you need to have a problem or a burning desire. A problem is paying $50,000 a year in taxes and being in pain writing that check, knowing how much more you could earn if you had that money to re-invest.</p>\n<p>A problem could also be feeling like you don&#8217;t fit in where you live now, or feeling unsafe in your home country, or feeling like you need a &#8220;Plan B&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A burning desire is something you want really badly, like a penthouse in London or a Monaco passport to show girls at the club.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a problem or a burning desire, I can&#8217;t help you. I get that some people are curious about this &#8220;offshore stuff&#8221;, but I&#8217;m only able to help people who can see past the &#8220;cool&#8221; factor and want to use my strategies to better their lives.</p>\n<p>Third, you need to be a positive person. We all get frustrated from time to time, but the point of doing this stuff is give you more options and a better life. If you&#8217;re always angry at the government, or American women, or whatever else, I can&#8217;t help you.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that unlike a lot of the self-styled offshore &#8220;gurus&#8221;, I don&#8217;t peddle doom-and-gloom. Sorry, but the US dollar won&#8217;t be used for toilet paper next week. I&#8217;m all for reasonable diversification, but if you&#8217;re stocking lima bean seeds in your underground bunker, you won&#8217;t like working with me.</p>\n<p><strong>Still with me? Here&#8217;s who I can help:</strong><br>\nSuccessful six- and seven-figure entrepreneurs and investors who want to live a better life keeping and re-investing more of their own money.</p>\n<p>Imagine what you would do with an extra $50,000 or $100,000 or $250,000 every year.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine what those kind of savings would add up to in ten years. For most entrepreneurs and investors, those kind of numbers are a serious game changer.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s who I&#8217;m here to help: people like you who want to offshore, but aren&#8217;t sure where to start.</p>\n<p>The offshore world can be confusing, and it can be hard to know where to start.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you know your time is better spent running your business than scouring he internet reading the latest forums, blogs, and websites on how to go offshore.</p>\n<h2>So here&#8217;s where I do the self-aggrandizing &#8220;sales pitch&#8221;. In the last few years, I have successfully:</h2>\n<p>Moved my businesses overseas to legally pay $0 in US tax (with the 2015 and 2016 tax returns to prove it)&#8230;</p>\n<p>Opened bank accounts at dozens of banks on four continents&#8230;</p>\n<p>Was approved for and obtained multiple second passports through all three major methods: investment, naturalization, and ancestry&#8230;</p>\n<p>Purchased investment properties in four countries&#8230;</p>\n<p>And so on. In other words, I live this stuff personally. In fact, I geek out on it. Who the heck needs a bank account in Peru?!</p>\n<p>Now, remember at the very beginning that I told you there are a lot of people who could help you with at least part of this stuff? Well, there&#8217;s one important lesson I&#8217;ve learned along the way. Allow me to explain:</p>\n<p>If you want to get second residency in Panama, you can call a lawyer in Panama. Odds are most won&#8217;t return your call, but those that do can sell you a Panama residency.</p>\n<p>Your Panamanian lawyer won&#8217;t understand WHY you want second residency and citizenship. In fact, he might think you&#8217;re crazy. After all, a lot of Panamanians want to live in the United States or Europe.</p>\n<p>That lawyer can sell you a service, but he won&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;re buying it. Big difference.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, you might be missing out on a far better opportunity for that second passport by only calling lawyers in one country. What if your best option is actually in Belgium&#8230; or Colombia&#8230; or Singapore?</p>\n<p>The guy in Panama won&#8217;t know much if anything about Singapore, and he certainly won&#8217;t tell you to go to another country. After all, he sells Panama. That&#8217;s his business.</p>\n<p>Worse yet, chances are that your Panama lawyer also won&#8217;t know anything about your requirements to pay taxes or file forms where you live now. For example, US citizens who start a Panama company have to report it to the IRS, but your Panama lawyer might not know that. And why should he? He&#8217;s a lawyer in Panama, not the United States.</p>\n<p>Do you get where I&#8217;m going with this?</p>\n<p>When I started doing this stuff years ago, there was nobody around to help. I suffered the same way you probably are right now: it seemed that no one person knew how to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.</p>\n<p>The only option was to call a bunch of those fancy lawyers in different countries and try to make it work yourself. It was like being the general contractor for building your own house, only the plumbing guy spoke German and the electrician spoke Albanian.</p>\n<p>You can create an offshore company, or open some bank accounts, or get a passport, but I&#8217;ve found that the key is making all of those things work together.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve spent years of my life doing: figuring out how to put all the pieces of the puzzle fit together to get the end result of more money, more time, and more freedom.</p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve also had a few failures. Fortunately, nothing too major &#8211; getting ripped off for $1,000 and having a Latvian bank give me a hard time &#8211; but those failures taught me that knowing what NOT to do is actually more important than what to do.</p>\n<p>Had I been able to put the puzzle pieces together earlier, I would have gotten results much faster.</p>\n<p>The crazy thing is that you could achieve my results in as little as one year. What took me almost ten years to master can be achieved by you in barely one-tenth the time.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for help creating a holistic offshore strategy that involves the proper structure to reduce or eliminate your taxes, get a second citizenship, and invest your money where the grass is greener (or any of the above), I can help you.</p>\n<p><strong>The question is &#8220;do you want my help?&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>I ask that because in my years of doing this, I&#8217;ve found most people don&#8217;t WANT help.</p>\n<p>For many people, getting a second passport or buying real estate in some tropical locale sounds sexy, but the desire to execute isn&#8217;t there.</p>\n<p>For the same reason men cheat on their wives, people are attracted to this stuff: boredom. Being a globetrotting man of mystery can seem a lot more intriguing than another sales meeting at a suburban Bennigan&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>So before you ask for help, make sure you need it. Unlike most of the nameless, faceless bloggers who use doom-and-gloom to scare you into paying them, I won&#8217;t try to &#8220;sell&#8221; you on why you need a second passport or an offshore company. Maybe you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest offshore &#8220;scams&#8221; is really just old-school salesmanship: that Panama lawyer telling you to buy the Panama company, or Panama trust, or Panama whatever that you don&#8217;t need.</p>\n<p>I could probably do a brisk business hustling everyone into thinking the US dollar is tomorrow&#8217;s toilet paper, but that&#8217;s not my game.</p>\n<p>The reason is that, quite honestly, I&#8217;m too busy doing this stuff myself. I had actually run successful businesses when I started Nomad Capitalist, which meant that I was able to do the trial-and-error on my own dime, then share what actually works.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned Panama lawyer takes on as many clients he can, and anyone who will pay the bill. I, on the other hand, am busy doing property deals and working with my team to develop other businesses ranging from importing balloons from China to selling Kindle books on Amazon.</p>\n<p>Because of that, I&#8217;ve silo-ed my calendar to speak only to the best people; people like you who are 100% serious about getting RESULTS, rather than more information.</p>\n<h2>&#8220;But Andrew; how do I know if your stuff is any good?&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Read, watch, or listen to any and all of my free materials.</p>\n<p>If you like what I have to say and the approach I take, you&#8217;ll probably like working with me.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t, you won&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>In the last year, I&#8217;ve helped 67 entrepreneurs like you put more than $4 million back in their pocket&#8230; and if they keep following my advice, those savings will repeat year. After year. After year.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to mention helping people move overseas and diversify their cash, or the clients who have gotten their second passports or made higher yield investments. For example, one of the best feelings I&#8217;ve had is seeing people I work with pick up their new passports.</p>\n<p>Doing this &#8220;offshore stuff&#8221; is kind of like that old example of doubling a penny every day. Once you start doing it, the returns start to compound. Before you know it, you&#8217;ve got something big.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve ANY of those results, you have to take action. I&#8217;m sure that I have turned some people off with my approach of fast action. I believe that we are all responsible for our circumstances, and that if you don&#8217;t take action, we don&#8217;t really want to change.</p>\n<p>So let me ask you: do YOU want a change?</p>\n<p>If so &#8211; if you&#8217;re tired of paying a fortune and getting nothing in return, tired of being tied to one country, and tired of not having the freedom you want &#8211; then let&#8217;s talk.</p>\n</div>","title":"Who is Andrew Henderson?"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b921d2787be0571ac1b0503"}}
