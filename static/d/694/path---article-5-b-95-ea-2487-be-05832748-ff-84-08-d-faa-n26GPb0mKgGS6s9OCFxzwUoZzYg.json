Most of the hostels are located on Perissa beach and near the port. You can book your hostel with <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhostels%2FSantorini%2FGreece%2FMap\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hostelworld</a> </p><p><strong>Budget hotel prices</strong> &#8211; You can find a hotel room in a budget hotel for 30 EUR per night. Hotels at this price point offer air-conditioning, free WiFi, a TV, a mini-fridge, a private bathroom and many offer free breakfast. Use <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?region=1513&amp;aid=362916&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Booking.com</a> as they consistently return the cheapest rates. On <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/?irgwc=1&amp;irclid=24aSyeyRVSO91P6T8RRvwxlWUkjXYMUUKzCZSU0&amp;ircid=4273&amp;sharedid=&amp;af=81115044&amp;iratid=9627\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb</a>, private rooms start at 25 EUR and entire homes (including studio apartments) can be rented for 40 EUR.</p><p><strong>Average cost of food</strong> &#8211; Food is not very expensive here. You&#8217;ll find a lot of cheap gyro (meat, cheese, sauce, onions, and tomatoes served on pita bread) and sandwich shops for about 4 EUR for a meal. Inexpensive restaurants will cost around 9 EUR. A nicer restaurant will cost around 18 EUR with a drink. Prices just go up from there. If you are eating in Oia, prices are about 30% higher because of all the tourists.  If you cook your meals, expect to pay 45-50 EUR per week for groceries that will include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic foods.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; A bus trip will cost you between 1.80-2.40 EUR depending on where you are going. That said, the buses are not the most consistent so prepare yourself for that. An alternative is renting an ATV, which many people use on the main roads. A daily rental starts at 30 EUR per day.  Taxis cost about 27 EUR to go across the island.</p></div>","title":"Santorini Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea2487be05832748ff84"}}
