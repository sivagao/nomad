Breakfast is usually included though.

It&#8217;s better to eat out for lunch rather than dinner since lunch menus are often under 20 EUR. If you go out for dinner, expect to pay between 35-55 EUR for a meal with drinks. Add 3 EUR for the &#8220;coperto&#8221; (sit down fee) that covers service and the bread at the table.There are a few places to get cheap snacks (pizza, sandwiches) but for the most part, budget a lot of money for food. If you find a discount grocer like Eurospin, In&#8217;s Mercato, LD Market, Lidl or Penny Market or you shop at the local farmer&#8217;s markets, you can get a week&#8217;s worth of groceries for about 60 &#8211; 70 EUR.</p><p><strong>Transportation costs</strong> &#8211; Venice is a pedestrian&#8217;s city. Unless you&#8217;re taking water taxis or floating buses, you&#8217;ll be walking. You can cross the canals by foot using bridges or you can take a &#8220;traghetto&#8221; (a gondola) for 2 EUR. If you need to get to places that are a bit further or your feet need a break, the floating buses, or &#8220;vaporetto,&#8221; cost 7.50 EUR for a one way, one hour trip. A 1-day ticket is 20 EUR and a 7-day pass is 60 EUR.</p></div>","title":"Venice Travel Guide: What to See, Do, Costs, & Ways to Save"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95ea8987be05832748ffb4"}}
