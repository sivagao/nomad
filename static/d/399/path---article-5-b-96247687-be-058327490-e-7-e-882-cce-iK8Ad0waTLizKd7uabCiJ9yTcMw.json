I&#8217;m very excited to have <a href=\"http://www.granadatur.com/en/\">Daniel Galan</a> and Arantxa Ros to chat with us about all things <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/spain-travel-information/\">Spain</a>. That&#8217;s your chance to drop in and ask about your Spanish travel fantasies with these two experts I both met in Spain over the last year. They&#8217;re also on the forefront of bringing travelers to Spain through social media and aren&#8217;t afraid to get geeky if you want to take the conversation in that direction.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Join The Chat</strong></p>\n<p>The chat takes place in the comments of a special post that will go live THIS THURSDAY December 1rst at these times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New York: 10am-1pm (US EST)</li>\n<li>Madrid: 4pm-7pm (CET)</li>\n<li>Bangkok: 10pm-1am (ICT)</li>\n<li>In another time zone? <a href=\"http://techguidefortravel.com/2011/04/19/easily-calculate-timezone-differences-with-world-time-engine/\">Find out the chat time in your city</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Come to any page on this site during the chat hours and there will be a <strong>gigantic </strong>banner atop where you can find the chat. It&#8217;s simple, free, and wouldn&#8217;t be the same without you.</p>\n<p><strong>Turn On Boss Mode And Sneak By To Say Hi</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you need a tapas-induced break from work or simply want to ask how everyone in Spain is not 1,000 kilos with such good food (please do, I&#8217;m curious myself) come by and say hi. I&#8217;ll also share the <a href=\"https://foxnomad.com/2011/11/01/the-best-comments-of-october-2011-and-live-chat-talking-travel-photography-and-rtws-with-guest-john-onolan/comment-page-1/#comment-186272\">best comments of the month</a> and have beer in hand. As for Arantxa in Tenerife and Daniel in Granada, I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;ll be drinking but can guarantee we&#8217;ll find out.</p>\n<p>Talk to you Thursday,<br>\n-Anil</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"Reminder: Live Chat Later Today Right Here And All About Spain"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b96247687be058327490e7e"}}
