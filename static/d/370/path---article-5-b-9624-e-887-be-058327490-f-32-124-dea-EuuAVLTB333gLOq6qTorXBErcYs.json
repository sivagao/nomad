(The United Nations sets that at 193, while the Montevideo Convention&#8217;s more interesting list is 201 &#8211; so I&#8217;ll go with that.) There&#8217;s still lots of world to see, write about, and share with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Evolving Styles Over Year 4<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Currently I&#8217;m in Valencia, Spain courtesy <a href=\"http://www.spain.info/\">Tour Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://en.comunitatvalenciana.com/home/home-english/493\">Valencia Tourism</a>, where I&#8217;m enjoying the city where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paella\">paella</a> was created in the late 19th century. Over the past 4th year of foXnoMad I&#8217;ve been focusing mainly on the Middle East, visiting (and <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/2011/04/14/3-common-personal-deficiencies-that-are-valuable-travel-assets/\">getting lost</a>) in <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/\">countries</a> like <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/oman-travel-information/\">Oman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/egypt-travel-information/\">Egypt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/turkey-travel-information/\">Turkey</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/countries/iraq-travel-information/\">Iraq</a> while trying to give my posts a more personal touch. A sharper focus on the visual element is on the way, as well as some major travel projects coming up toward the end of the year.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?i=840556&amp;c=single&amp;cl=67825\"><img src=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ultimate-tech-guide-nook.jpg\" alt=\"ultimate tech guide for travelers\" width=\"240\" height=\"319\"></a>The Ultimate Tech Guide For Travelers 50% Off Today Only</strong></p>\n<p>For foXnoMad&#8217;s birthday, today only <a href=\"http://www.foxnomad.com/travel-ebooks/the-ultimate-tech-guide-for-travelers/\">The Ultimate Tech Guide For Travelers</a> is 50% off &#8211; but still includes 6 months of free personal travel tech support for yours truly.
