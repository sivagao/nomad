So when we were introduced to&#160;this homestay in Samut Songkhram called Baan Suan Krua, it was love at first sight. In a town not far from the southwestern outskirts of Bangkok, it&#8217;s the perfect place to spend a long weekend getaway for 1500 baht (about $45 USD) per night.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h2><p id=\"Kicking_Back_at_a_Homestay_in_Samut_Songkhram\"><p>Kicking Back at a Homestay in Samut Songkhram</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12885\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-17.jpg?resize=1000%2C697&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Beautiful garden area at Baan Suan Krua, a homestay in Samut Songkhram\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\"></p>\n<p>This charming&#160;homestay in Samut Songkhram is called Baan Suan Krua (&#3610;&#3657;&#3634;&#3609;&#3626;&#3623;&#3609;&#3588;&#3619;&#3633;&#3623;), which literally means House Garden Kitchen. Tucked away from the main road, we arrived there just after sunset and walked into&#160;an&#160;outdoor dining area surrounded by lush greenery, soft lights, and an overall wonderful ambiance.</p>\n<p>The property hugs the banks of a canal&#160;and features a privacy fence made of blossoming foliage.&#160;There are several lounge chairs and umbrellas that overlook the canal.&#160;That area also features an outdoor grill and prep area if you&#8217;d like to do some cooking outside. There&#8217;s an&#160;above ground pool, swings and hammocks, and even paddle boats to take a scenic trip up the canal.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12892\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-12.jpg?resize=1000%2C662&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Baan Suan Krua garden dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\"></p>\n<p>The homestay was once a two-story traditional Thai teak home. The owners of Baan Suan Krua live on the top level of this Thai stilt house&#160;and later converted the open-aired lower level into three separate spacious units.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Modern_GardenRooms\"><p>Modern Garden&#160;Rooms</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12886\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-20.jpg?resize=1000%2C648&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Spacious room at Baan Suan Krua, a homestay in Samut Songkhram\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\"><br>\nA few steps past the formal outdoor dining area, we entered into what was perhaps the largest accommodation&#160;in Thailand we&#8217;ve ever been in.</p>\n<p>Bright, clean, and simple. And cold AC!&#160;The room&#160;even came with a second mattress&#160;that&#160;we used while getting our Thai massages that evening. It&#8217;s not in the picture, but there&#8217;s also a huge flat screen TV mounted on the wall in front of the bed as well as a fan.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12887\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-18.jpg?resize=1000%2C662&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Spacious Room at Baan Suan Krua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\"></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a desk area within arm&#8217;s reach of a mini fridge.

It features a modern toilet and a hot water shower complete with a rain shower head and a shower curtain. Wow! That&#8217;s something we rarely see in Thailand!&#160;The shower also included dispensers of shampoo and body wash&#160;that&#160;can double as hand soap.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Alms_to_the_Monks\"><p>Alms to the Monks</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-10.jpg?resize=1000%2C608&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Alms to monks at Baan Suan Krua Homestay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\"></p>\n<p>An incredibly unique feature of this homestay in Samut Songkhram is being able to give merit to the monks as a guest. Every day in the early morning between&#160;6:00am and&#160;6:15am, monks from a nearby temple silently make the journey up the canal in their long canoes and pass by Baan Suan Krua.</p>\n<p>The homestay has a small set of stairs that lead down into the water. Making prior arrangements with the owners, we gave&#160;offerings to the monks of steamed rice and a small bag of a stir-fry or curry dish, in addition to orchid flowers, incense, and candles.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Dining_Options\"><p>Dining Options</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12895\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-Breakfast-Collage-1000px.jpg?resize=1000%2C496&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Breakfast spread at Baan Suan Krua Homestay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"496\"></p>\n<p>Guests at&#160;Baan Suan Krua are welcomed to shop at the local market and bring the goods back to cook dinner themselves.&#160;As an alternative,&#160;the owners are happy to whip up a few of their Thai favorites using whatever is in the kitchen at the time, which is open from 7:00am to 9:00pm.</p>\n<p>Breakfast is included in&#160;the price of the homestay and includes fresh local fruit, freshly baked bread(!) with butter and jam spreads, and instant coffee and hot tea. The owners also offered us a hot plate of fried eggs, garlic toast, and ham and sausage&#160;with&#160;a small side salad. If you prefer a Thai breakfast of rice porridge (kao dum), they have that, too.&#160;They offer fresh espresso and tea drinks from their drink menu in addition to their breakfast options.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Service\"><p>Service</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12890\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baan-Suan-Krua-Homestay-1000px-9.jpg?resize=1000%2C662&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Baan Suan Krua Homestay 1000px (9)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\"></p>\n<p>The service was excellent and the grounds and room were well taken care of.

We enjoyed having meals outside in their beautiful garden area, the quaint&#160;privacy of the property, and the one-of-a-kind experience of giving merit to monks along the canal.</p>\n<p>We also enjoyed some of the&#160;best Thai massages we&#8217;ve ever had in Thailand, which were conveniently hosted onsite. We highly recommend getting one during your stay at a going rate of 400 baht per two hours.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Baan Suan Krua is near&#160;the city center of the Samut Songkhram province, which is about an hour and a half drive southwest from Bangkok. The best way to book this homestay is by contacting them directly through Facebook or email, as they are not listed on major hotel booking sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>\n<strong>Facebook:</strong> <a title=\"Baan Suan Krua Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BaanSuanKrua\" target=\"_blank\">BaanSuanKrua Amphawa</a><br>\n<strong>Phone:</strong> (086) 989-0577 or (085) 188-1338</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing place to spend a few days, whether you are traveling alone, with a significant other, or with family, Baan Suan Krua is&#160;the place to go.
