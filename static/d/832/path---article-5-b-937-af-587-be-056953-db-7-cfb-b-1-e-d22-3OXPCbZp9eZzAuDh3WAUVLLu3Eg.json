There&#8217;s been quite a lot of Digital Nomad discussion as of late. It&#8217;s a title which will become commonplace a few years from now. Till then, we as a community still have many experiences to share, here are mine.</p><p name=\"f62d\" id=\"f62d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Note: This article doesn&#8217;t discuss travel as a whole. Travel insurance, handling money, air mileage programs, dealing with corruption, jet lag, learning languages, freak street food, etc. These are all covered in full elsewhere already.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4Dnm6xd_18o0s-6tFaGr0w.jpeg\">First trip of the year&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;Paris, France (Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kinetoskop/sets/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manual Schmalstieg</a>)<p name=\"f95d\" id=\"f95d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Change one thing at a time. </strong>Being a nomad brings chaos to your day to day. If this is the road you want to go down, other variables need to be on lock. Don&#8217;t try to transition between responsibilities whilst traveling between countries.</p><p name=\"d3f6\" id=\"d3f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t say &#8220;I&#8217;ll be my own boss&#8221; without knowing exactly what you&#8217;re a boss of. Traveling constantly exposes you to (good) distractions whilst also being in pursuit of reliable infrastructure. Your work is the one thing that shouldn&#8217;t shift dramatically as you change locations. You need to have a strong vision of where you&#8217;re going, even if ultimately you have no idea where it&#8217;ll take you.</p><p name=\"0051\" id=\"0051\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In practical terms, you should have a granular and established way of generating income. As I&#8217;m constantly on the road, notepads have become impractical, so I use two <a href=\"http://trello.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a> boards to collect all professional and personal tasks. Whilst it doesn&#8217;t have offline capability yet, <a href=\"https://trello.com/c/9PTAcL1Q/92-edit-while-offline\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">they are working on it</a>. Your routine should be strong enough to be able sit anywhere and get into it within minutes, you need to have a system for work as opposed to simply being reactive to email.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*p7pIcynGLLF1G6kkhHieMA.jpeg\">Byron Bay, Australia (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/qllb5anCFR/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"ab0e\" id=\"ab0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Travel light. </strong>After 45 flights in the last 12 months, there&#8217;s no place for checked luggage. This goes without saying, but all you need is a carry-on.</p><p name=\"03a3\" id=\"03a3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The traditional Digital Nomad (as we&#8217;re led to believe) pursues a sunny and warm path. If the same applies to you, there&#8217;s no need to bring anything more than a few tees, shorts, flips flops and your work gear. Other things you need can be sourced/shared on site; shower stuff, sun cream, etc.</p><p name=\"024d\" id=\"024d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take pride in purchasing for quality and flexibility, price isn&#8217;t always reflective. <a href=\"http://www.luminox.com/watches/sea/?watch=A.3051\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luminox</a> watches are great in and around the ocean, <a href=\"http://www.gillette.com/en/in/products/razors/mach3/mach3.aspx\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gillette &#8220;Sensitive&#8221; blades</a> are fine if you don&#8217;t have shaving cream and the <a href=\"http://www.skross.com/content/product/cat/id_cat/9/name/World+Travel+Adapter\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skross World Travel Adapter</a> hasn&#8217;t failed me yet (the <a href=\"http://refer.hellonomad.com/v2/share/6090785859960092988\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NomadClip</a> is also cool).</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1tEFnQEaAa-0j4f8UiBngA.jpeg\"><p name=\"3482\" id=\"3482\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Your carry-on will often be overweight (limits have been reduced to a typical 7&#8211;8kg), have a secondary bag ready to go. I already pack all of my work gear in a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=cinch+bag\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cinch bag</a> inside of my carry-on as I don&#8217;t want to be fumbling around the overhead compartment inflight. Carry-on luggage gets beat up in no time, consider <a href=\"http://www.tumi.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tumi</a> or <a href=\"http://www.samsonite.com/home/home.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsonite</a> for something more rugged.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WKbi0zpVP0NaNmoHHYb1sA.jpeg\">London, United Kingdom (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/lmYujDHCJc/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"5b15\" id=\"5b15\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Complete Infrastructure. </strong>Infrastructure isn&#8217;t synonymous to internet. If your idea of being a digital nomad is taking your laptop with you on a vacation, then you can&#8217;t really appreciate the need for a complete infrastructure. Everyone has a routine, in most cases you don&#8217;t need to sacrifice essentials in the slightest. If you don&#8217;t plan however, you&#8217;ll invariably break routine which in turn impacts work.</p><p name=\"7146\" id=\"7146\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you&#8217;re backpacking, staying at youth hostels, there&#8217;ll likely be more downtime trying to sort stuff out. If you freelance, increase your rates to the point that you can continually afford a setup that respects your time. For me that&#8217;s reliable WiFi, a kitchen, laundry facilities as well as close proximity to a gym and a decent grocery store. I&#8217;m not compromising on what I had before, I simply have to plan for it more than before.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1zksWyiHuCOqUMNmxNVeSw.jpeg\">Night Market, Phuket Town, Thailand (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/pPsA_pnCLB/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"f100\" id=\"f100\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Exercise.</strong> Especially with the shorter trips, it&#8217;s easy to completely bail on physical activity whilst doubling the nights out. I&#8217;ve fallen prey to it, but have gotten better about it. The key is not to rely solely on the gym experience, but on independent tools. Besides running and swimming, there are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyweight_exercise\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bodyweight exercises</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trxtraining.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TRX</a> as nice additions to cardio (both of which have plenty of apps for all phones). The only downside of TRX is that it weighs in slightly under a kilogram.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ENEOWuTFdyn-DVixaF4z_g.jpeg\"><p name=\"3488\" id=\"3488\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As with any exercise, it&#8217;s always more motivating/productive to do it with others. Recruit or team up with people from your co-working space, surf classes or otherwise.</p><p name=\"0cc2\" id=\"0cc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you&#8217;re a gym rat (I still enjoy using them), you&#8217;ll get a daily rate at any establishment. Again, negotiate for the term you&#8217;re staying. As you&#8217;ll have odd dates, it&#8217;s easy to negotiate on (i.e. getting 6 weeks for the price of a month). Don&#8217;t let travel break this routine.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HWV94Udg4AvLcoKdK7mGOw.jpeg\">Empty Airbus, over the Gulf of Thailand (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/oxXG2XnCDE/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"b50f\" id=\"b50f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Accommodation.</strong> I mostly stick to Airbnb (entire home/apartments) because I want to minimise uncertainty. A clear and concise listing with multiple reviews mitigates that. You&#8217;ll have plenty of other things challenging you in your new environment, be smart about which ones you can already take care of before landing.</p><p name=\"0a23\" id=\"0a23\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are two nomad advantages that provide room to negotiate on Airbnb.</p><p name=\"4fa2\" id=\"4fa2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, the average Airbnb guest stays for anywhere from <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/airbnb-economic-impact/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3 to 7 days</a>. By being someone that is seeking 30 or more days, you become of great value to a host. You&#8217;re cutting down on their administrative time (correspondence, welcome tour, etc.) as well as removing frictional downtime (gaps between guest stays).</p><p name=\"66c5\" id=\"66c5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Second, the average Airbnb guest <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/05/airbnb_new_booking_app_last_minute_reservations_available_in_l_a_and_san.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">books 30 days in advance</a>. By booking a few days before, you&#8217;re creating a last minute opportunity for a host to make (any) revenue. Whilst Airbnb is trying to cater towards this impulsive behaviour, there&#8217;ll continue to be ample supply of hosts willing to negotiate.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zt2l7RwaFcsewIoEkmCo4Q.jpeg\">Good reviews go a long way in creating trust and opening the door for negotiation.<p name=\"d5d3\" id=\"d5d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">There&#8217;s a third opportunity unrelated to being a nomad; take a risk and go with your gut feeling on zero review places. Promise to write a comprehensive review in exchange for a discount.</p><p name=\"add6\" id=\"add6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The above is certainly not an exact science. As a baseline, I&#8217;ll get 10% off any normal stay (staying one week, booked a month in advance) after a simple message asking if they&#8217;re running any deals. Beyond that you&#8217;re looking at anything from 20% to 50% off.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ndKajehc_0ec8o8g2r93GQ.jpeg\">Brooklyn Bridge, New York City, USA (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/rRiVdbnCEc/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"638c\" id=\"638c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Work environment. </strong>R.I.P. battle-station with multiple screens, ergonomic chair, keyboard, surround sound and all the other toys. I thought I&#8217;d miss it, but it turns out a mouse and great headphones go a long way. I usually bring three headphones with me. The traditional Apple <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic?fnode=75\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ones</a>, some <a href=\"http://www.rha-audio.com/uk/headphones/ma600i.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in-ear RHA&#8217;s</a> and my <a href=\"http://store.sony.com/digital-noise-canceling-headphones-zid27-MDR1RNC/cat-27-catid-All-Headphones-Earbuds\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sony MDR-1NC</a>. Blocking out noise is vital for my work and finding flow. I have a work <a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/1117319416/playlist/6dlwJYNRdkTfZMALZclyIx\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify playlist here</a> and @philip_arthur also has a <a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/127552775/playlist/2Ne8PX1Gaqm6eEpYOlvtGa\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">good one here</a>, go premium to have that offline availability.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*p4U-p0VhIj7M9Nd-U5IDoQ.jpeg\"><p name=\"9d27\" id=\"9d27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Most places you&#8217;ll stay at will have also have an LCD TV so why not use it as a second monitor? Invest in a cable (like the one above) that has a male HDMI end and you have a big screen everywhere.</p><p name=\"13f7\" id=\"13f7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As for where to work. Co-working spaces are spawning everywhere and they&#8217;re really growing on me. There&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.sharedesk.net/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ShareDesk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.desksurfing.net/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">desksurfing</a> and other aggregators. As I write this, I&#8217;m sitting in <a href=\"http://www.thesurfoffice.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Surf Office</a> in Gran Canaria, a definite to-do for anyone looking to surf and work in Europe. Whilst cafe&#8217;s are cool too, it&#8217;s simply not the same. I&#8217;d rate non-professional spaces roughly one third less productive. Again, eliminate uncertainty in advance where possible.</p><p name=\"d286\" id=\"d286\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;ve also <a href=\"https://medium.com/@noeltock/beyond-the-code-1d8e8f2f2de0\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">written on increasing productivity and work quality</a>.</p><p name=\"e787\" id=\"e787\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Playing it by ear and ending up in Starbucks is a cop out.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*b-LJc2KvpAysV2JHptbsIQ.jpeg\">Airbnb, Manly Beach, Australia (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/qGLhhCHCNa/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"b71b\" id=\"b71b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Press Pause.</strong> Traveling as a nomad isn&#8217;t a vacation, you need plenty of time to work comfortably without feeling rushed. What&#8217;s the point otherwise?</p><p name=\"21b8\" id=\"21b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I fell into the nomadic lifestyle by accident after a number of back to back trips for work. These trips were short in nature, never longer than one or two weeks, sometimes just a day. This doesn&#8217;t create enough time to settle down, relax and reflect. At that stage, we simply get stuck in execution, failing by defining ourselves as being busy. Need proof? Simply track the sort of work you do while you&#8217;re traveling using <a href=\"http://www.rescuetime.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Time</a>.</p><p name=\"8edb\" id=\"8edb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s crucial you take at least four to six weeks in any given location to hang around and take it all in. Having a co-working space that goes a step further (providing accommodation, doing activities) like here at the Surf Office help ease those travel pains. Travelling in groups provide a similar experience as long as you&#8217;re aligned on goals/intent.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Xgnq-GbYVzIYeFZJi1o1cg.jpeg\">El Cotillo Beach, Fuerteventura, Canary Islands (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/m0BNZynCJ5/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"9b6b\" id=\"9b6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Prepare for offline.</strong> It&#8217;s inevitable, you will be offline, a lot. You can mitigate that stuff with some planning; cheap 3G SIM cards or getting a dongle (say you stay in Spain for a few months every year, invest in an annual subscription).</p><p name=\"e3a4\" id=\"e3a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That said, it&#8217;ll still happen that you&#8217;ll be completely offline (which doesn&#8217;t have to be a bad thing, the contrary rather). In those cases, before switching locations, I do a few things:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"23b8\" id=\"23b8\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Pull down all current GitHub repo&#8217;s for active branches.</li><li name=\"8c27\" id=\"8c27\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Sync ReadKit / Pocket</li><li name=\"f5bc\" id=\"f5bc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Sync Kindle reading positions across devices (I like to bounce between 2&#8211;3 books at a time on both MacBook Air &amp; iPhone, don&#8217;t have room for a physical Kindle).</li></ul><p name=\"a450\" id=\"a450\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If you&#8217;re going to Eastern Europe, ignore this comment (free and open WiFi everywhere). If you&#8217;re going to Australia, bring your wallet and patience.</p><p name=\"1a39\" id=\"1a39\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As airports and airplanes build more power sockets and laptops stay on longer, the question of power is becoming less of an issue. A 13\" MacBook Air will run you up to 12 hours (as long as you halt vagrant and other battery draining services).</p><p name=\"2fc7\" id=\"2fc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An external battery pack for your phone is also always helpful, be considerate of weight though (they easily get to half a kilogram).</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nT4eFSg_4iDi0ueOpZFv9g.jpeg\">Trysil, Norway (<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/jwh0IcnCAZ/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>)<p name=\"b78a\" id=\"b78a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Connect.</strong> Regardless of your reasons for hitting the road, find time to touch base with other nomads and travellers. I&#8217;m always amazed at their stories, travel hacks and perspective on it all.
