Some weeks it will be a really fun&#160;<strong>interview about packing, fashion, and fitness</strong>&#160;so you can snoop inside their bags &amp; lives a little bit and other weeks it&#8217;ll be a&#160;<strong>detailed</strong>&#160;<strong>luxury guide</strong>&#160;to a city the featured blogger/expat knows very well.&#160;E-mail me if you&#8217;d like to be featured.</p><h1>A Luxury Guide to&#160;Whistler</h1><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Tell us a little about&#160; yourself and tell us why you&#8217;re an expert on luxury travel in Whistler.</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Hi I&#8217;m Aimee and I&#8217;ve been living abroad for the past five years &#8211; firstly In San Franciso, then in Sydney and finally in Whistler. But, I&#8217;m an Irish girl true and true having been raised in the beautiful Emerald Isle. I love to travel and this past year I undertook the impressive feat of travelling to 16 countries in a year. It was and still is the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done. Anyway, enough about me, let&#8217;s move on to the scenic town of Whistler nestled in the mountains of British Columbia. I have lived here since May of this year and honestly it&#8217;s the prettiest place I&#8217;ve ever called home. There are hundreds of reasons why you should make Whistler your next luxury travel destination.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What makes Whistler a perfect destination for travelers seeking a glamorous trip?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Whistler is picture-perfect, it&#8217;s one of those places that has you saying &#8216;wow&#8217; every 10 steps. It&#8217;s renowned the world over for its skiing, but for me there&#8217;s so much more to Whistler. From luxury hotels back-dropped by snow-capped mountains to some of the best restaurants in the world &#8211; <a href=\"https://thefittraveller.com/explore/canada-year-round-travel-guide-whistler/\">Whistler</a> has everything you could ask for of a luxury travel destination.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13095\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC02976.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13098\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC03097.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What 5 star hotel is the best in Whistler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">The <strong><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Four_Seasons_Resort_Whistler.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Four Seasons</a></strong> located in Whistler&#8217;s upper village provides an epic panorama of Blackcomb Mountain. Inside the hotel massive open fireplaces welcome you with open arms and the rooms although luxurious provide a home away from home experience.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What about boutique hotels in Whistler, of them all, which would you send your friends or family to stay at?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7623084/type/dlg/http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Nita_Lake_Lodge.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nita Lake Lodge</a></b><b> </b>is considered one of the best hotels in the Whistler area. Built on the serene Nita Lake and a 5 minute drive from Whistler village &#8211; Nita Lake provides the tranquil and luxurious experience that most tourists to Whistler are looking for.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13099\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151204_211046.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Are there any fun activities for the adventurous traveler in Whistler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Lots. Whistler has everythng from dog-sledding the nearby Callaghan Valley, a wine tasting tour of Whistler village and surrounding areas and heli skiing over Whistler Blackcomb Mountain. All once-in-a-lifetime experiences, I promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Where are the best hang outs during the day in Whistler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">In the summer a walk to Lost Lake is a must-see.&#160; A beautiful nature trail that offers a true Pacific Northwest nature experience. Sit on the banks of the lake and take in the magnificent views or if you&#8217;re feeling brave take a swim in its refreshing waters. The best cafe in my opinion is Camp Coffee &amp; Lifestyle Co. in Function Junction &#8211; fantastic coffee in a modern lifestyle store.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13101\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/received_1094866033857330.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>If you have a big date night, what are the most delicious restaurants in Whistler and what are their best dishes?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">My number one choice is <a href=\"http://www.rimrockcafe.com/\">Rimrock Cafe</a> near Creekside Village. It is continually ranked as the top restaurant in Whistler, it provides both a unique dining experience and the best fish dishes&#8217; in all of British Columbia, in my opinion. A close second is Araxi in Whistler village which has some very innovative dishes including</p><p class=\"p1\">Quebec Rabbit dish (which is my personal favourite) . Also, worth a mention is Bearfoot Bistro with its famed wine cellar &#8211; it has one of the most extensive wine cellars in all of Canada. Their butter poached Atlantic Salmon is amzing.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13097\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC03093.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts in Whistler- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Purebread is famous in Whistler. You won&#8217;t miss it, as there is usually a long winding queue out this small Cafe&#8217;s door. Their tantalising display of sweets has everything from Sticky Toffee Pudding to Raspberry Cheesecake Brownie. Pure mouth-watering bliss.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>What are a couple of the best salons and spas in Whistler?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Scandinave Spa allows you to relax in the heart of nature. A nordic-inspired 20,000 square foot outdoor spa surrounded by cedar trees. Soak in the outdoor hot tub and experience the beautiful vista of Whistlers natural beauty.</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC03015.jpg?resize=560%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Time for a great sunset view in Whistler&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Lost Lake, in particular the huge pier along the right-side of the lake is an amazing setting to catch the sunset over Whistler Mountain.</p><p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Now that the sun&#8217;s gone down, fill us on the best places to go for some evening drinks or a great pre-gaming spot. </i></b></p><p class=\"p1\">Bar Oso offers a profusion of Spanish-influenced small plates and fantastic cocktails in a cosy yet sophisticated environment. With 20,000 plus wine bottles, Bearfoot Bistro&#8217;s wine cellar is a must-see, you can also try your hand at sabering a bottle of champagne.</p><blockquote><p>Read more tips in Canada:&#160;<a href=\"http://www.seehertravel.com/free-things-to-do-in-victoria-bc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free things to do in Victoria</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-13097 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSC03093.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Luxury Guide to Whistler\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Aimee is an events professional and travel blogger from Ireland, now living in Whistler.&#160; With a background in journalism and a passion for offering travelling advice and photography on her blog <a href=\"http://snaphappytravelsblog.wordpress.com/\">Snap Happy Travels</a>.
