Habit of collecting ideas</strong></p><p name=\"b506\" id=\"b506\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have a habit to put every single idea for problems that I have into a list. Without judgments, evaluation or thinking, I put every single idea on to that list. This means that my idea for &#8220;Uber Horse&#8221; is even written down. I use Trello and I have about 10&#8211;15 ideas naturally per month. Keeping a list of ideas is crucial to making sure that once one product is launched, I have the choice to choose which product I want to launch next. Some of my ideas, prioritized before Uber Horse, are creating a marketplace for buying crypto with Paypal and launching Progress Bar OSX.</p><p name=\"f868\" id=\"f868\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2.

I tried to complete 10 courses but I never finished any of them. I&#8217;m using programing as a tool to implement my ideas in life. For me, learn programming is not a final goal. I just learned by Googling things like &#8220;Swift menu bar OS X&#8221;. Some man say this is not the best approach because I will not learn programming basics. But I don&#8217;t want to learn basics.</p><p name=\"f44f\" id=\"f44f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is definitely bad if I have a goal to to find a developer job because they will probably ask me on interview about algorithms. encapsulation, a bunch of other stuff. But I don&#8217;t want to find a developer job so I don&#8217;t care. And guess what. Users don&#8217;t care either.&#160;:) We keep seeing these articles &#8220;Web Developer Skills 2018&#8221;, &#8220;Roadmap of iOS Developer&#8221; paths with tons of tools that you need to know. Lists of 10 books with 400 pages that you need to read before you even can try to make something.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><p class=\"iframeContainer\"></p><p name=\"1ea3\" id=\"1ea3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you are learning programming as a tool to implement your ideas it&#8217;s much more fun and interesting.
