I&#8217;m giving my time and energy to people who need help, but I&#8217;m getting so much back in return that it almost feels as though I&#8217;m the one benefiting the most. Volunteering is a great way to give back and get back while you travel. Here are nine reasons to make volunteering a part of your next backpacking trip:</p><ul><li><strong>Get involved in the local community</strong> &#8211; As a volunteer, you&#8217;ll often find yourself well off the tourist trail and <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/why-travel-can-change-the-world/\">immersed in a world</a> that a traveler passing through would never experience. This will mean plenty of invites into people&#8217;s homes, to weddings, trips to beautiful spots that aren&#8217;t in the pages of your guidebook, and getting to participate in local events like pig hunts, voodoo festivals, fishing trips, local soccer matches, and all sorts of really cool events.</li><li><strong>Make new friends</strong> &#8211; Spending a bit of time volunteering will allow you to meet all sorts of people you would never have otherwise crossed paths with, and working together towards a common goal makes it easy to make friends.</li><li><strong>Become more socially conscious</strong> &#8211; Often volunteering will be done in parts of the world that are very poor, with people living on less than you might spend on a coffee back home. Living differently from your day-to-day life at home could help you to reassess your priorities and become more socially conscious.</li><li><strong>Gain work experience</strong> &#8211; Volunteering of any kind looks great on your resume and international volunteering looks great for anyone interested in development work, disaster relief, teaching, social work, and many other careers. It&#8217;s not paid work experience, but it will give you something to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-represent-travel-on-your-resume/\">pad out your resume</a>, which is especially helpful for students or recent graduates.</li><li><strong>Learn a new language</strong> &#8211; Spending time immersed in a foreign community is a great opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/four-step-language-learning/\">pick up the local language</a>. If you&#8217;re volunteering in a remote area, you&#8217;ll have plenty of people who can&#8217;t speak English to practice with.</li><li><strong>Save money</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re able to find a <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-travel-and-work-around-the-world-with-wwoof/\">volunteering opportunity where living expenses are covered</a>, you probably won&#8217;t spend much money. Volunteering for weeks or months at a time could allow you to live more cheaply than you would at home.</li><li><strong>Get fit</strong> &#8211; Not all volunteering opportunities involve physical work, but there are plenty out there for you if you&#8217;re interested in getting sweaty. Disaster relief work and farm work are both great for getting fit and challenging yourself physically.</li><li><strong>Have a base for more traveling</strong> &#8211; Volunteering isn&#8217;t all hard work, and often you&#8217;ll be given evenings and weekends off. This leaves plenty of time for exploring the area and meeting locals. It&#8217;s a great way to get the local experience travelers so often talk about.</li><li><strong>Help people</strong> &#8211; With all the other benefits you get from volunteering, it&#8217;s easy to forget the biggest one of all: the satisfaction that comes from helping out, even if just a little bit. While people have varying motivations for volunteering, one thing they all have in common is that they&#8217;re helping people in need, and that brings a great sense of satisfaction.</li></ul><p>There are lots of people out there who need your help and <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/volunteer-abroad/\">plenty of local organizations to volunteer with</a>. You don&#8217;t need to pay thousands to volunteer, you just need to look a little harder to find placements that are free or charge a reasonable living cost. Make the effort to make volunteering a part of your next backpacking trip. You won&#8217;t regret it!</p><p>Kirsty left Canada in 2001 and has been traveling, working, and volunteering abroad ever since.
