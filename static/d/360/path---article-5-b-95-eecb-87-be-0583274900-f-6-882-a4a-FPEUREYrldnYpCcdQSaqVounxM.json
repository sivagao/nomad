A major snow storm is currently headed to the Washington DC area from the northwest, so we think that everyone had their flights rescheduled from Wednesday to Tuesday to avoid the imminent delays and cancellations. We were lucky enough to grab the last two seats open next to each other, but I have to say, the back row of the plane is quite uncomfortable&#8230;especially if you are 6&#8217;2&#8243; and 220lbs. We will endure about 24 hours of flight time mixed with about 10 hours of layover time in Seattle and Taipei. We have everything we own in two carry ons and one checked bag each. We have no complaints though. I mean we could be sitting behind our desks wasting away at work, right? We are excited, tired from the late night packing, and a little nervous too. The nerves are because it looks like our cat, MooShu, who is supposed to be shipped 24 hours after us, could be delayed a day or two because of the weather, but we will keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>More to follow!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Its Tight Sitting Back Here...\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130305-171145.jpg?resize=563%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Inside of a Southwest Flight\" width=\"563\" height=\"420\"></p>\n \n<p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\">You May Also Like</h3>\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>","title":"The 34 hour Journey Beginsâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b95eecb87be0583274900f6"}}
