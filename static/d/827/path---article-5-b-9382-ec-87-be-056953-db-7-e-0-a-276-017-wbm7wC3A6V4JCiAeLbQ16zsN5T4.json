And it&#8217;s not that I wasn&#8217;t an important part of the team, it&#8217;s just that when everyone else is there, sometimes you just forget the &#8220;exception&#8221;.</p><p name=\"35aa\" id=\"35aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And that sucked. I know I could have been way more productive if I felt like I was really part of the team.</p><p name=\"0b41\" id=\"0b41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By having everyone remote, everyone is on the same page. There aren&#8217;t many different ways to communicate. Everyone uses the same tool.</p><p name=\"5e14\" id=\"5e14\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the previous companies I worked for removed their office and started working remotely. That didn&#8217;t stop them from making and releasing the successful Halcyon 6 game.</p><p name=\"071e\" id=\"071e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In Power Level Studio&#8217;s case, we&#8217;re releasing Soul Reaper: Unreap Commander on April 3rd. The game was built from December 2017 to March 2018.</p><h4 name=\"fde2\" id=\"fde2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Limit The Need To Communicate Verbally</h4><p name=\"16ad\" id=\"16ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">We never communicate verbally at Power Level Studios. I don&#8217;t remember the last time it happened.</p><p name=\"1cb2\" id=\"1cb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In fact, we rarely communicate at all. It&#8217;s all about our streamlined process.</p><p name=\"0b59\" id=\"0b59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kanban</a> approach.</p><p name=\"01f4\" id=\"01f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We have a series of steps a task needs to go through. When the person working on the task is done with the step, they move the card to the next step, where the next person in charge of the task will automatically be notified. In review steps, if it passes, the card moves forward, if it fails, it goes backward, where the person responsible for the work will automatically be notified.</p><p name=\"535d\" id=\"535d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s all about the automation and having a clear indicator of who needs to do what when.</p><h4 name=\"d81a\" id=\"d81a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Be Fully Transparent</h4><p name=\"8c8e\" id=\"8c8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">With the Kanban approach mentioned above, we have different boards depending on the type of work. We have boards for Art, Design, Admin, Programming, etc.</p><p name=\"e2b9\" id=\"e2b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Every board is public to everyone at the company.</p><p name=\"cda2\" id=\"cda2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I&#8217;ve got nothing to hide.</p><p name=\"aa70\" id=\"aa70\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Everyone can see what I&#8217;m working on at any point. That is very important. People working with me need to know that I&#8217;m not just barking orders from the beach working on my sun-tan.</p><h4 name=\"497b\" id=\"497b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Trust Your&#160;Team</h4><p name=\"e1cb\" id=\"e1cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I rarely make decisions. I&#8217;m not sure if that throws my team off or not, but that&#8217;s my management style. I like to have everyone&#8217;s input on aspects I trust them on. I would not ask an artists&#8217; opinion on programming, but I will definitely ask them about monster and loot design.</p><p name=\"38a6\" id=\"38a6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Everyone can submit their design ideas and we collaborate on it. I rarely get the ideas all by myself. We vote on design ideas, names of monsters, etc.</p><p name=\"3ca8\" id=\"3ca8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If my artist tells me A is better than B, I rarely argue. They&#8217;re the expert.</p><p name=\"29cf\" id=\"29cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">By trusting everyone, I know they trust and respect me more in return. They know we&#8217;re working towards the same goals.</p></div>","title":"Running A Company Remotely Is Possible But Not Easy â€” Here Are Some Tips To Make It Easier"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9382ec87be056953db7e0a"}}
