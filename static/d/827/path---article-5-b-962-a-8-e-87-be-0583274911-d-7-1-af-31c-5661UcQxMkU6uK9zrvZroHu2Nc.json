If you enjoy that too, keep calm and read on!</p><p>For those of you who are not familiar with this word, first of all, I guess we have to answer one essential question:</p><blockquote><p>What Does &lt;&lt;Urbex&gt;&gt; Stand For?<br> The word &#8220;urbex&#8221; is a fusion of &#8220;urban&#8221; and &#8220;exploration&#8221;.</p></blockquote><p>Briefly speaking, &#160;urbex is all about exploring and indulging the abandoned, urban areas. Sounds creepy? Not really!</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21528\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/What-Is-Urbex-Travel-Trends-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Why the Urbex Travel Trend is The Coolest New Thing in Adventure Travel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21523\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/What-Is-Urbex-Travel-Trends-3.jpg?resize=1018%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Why the Urbex Travel Trend is The Coolest New Thing in Adventure Travel\" width=\"1018\" height=\"1024\"></p><h2>What Makes Urbex a Unique Way to Travel</h2><h3>Urbex has it all.</h3><p>It is a blend of discovery, photography,&#160;and sport.

You will certainly not go to a five-star hotel if you wish to have a true urban exploration feeling. What else could you think of? Possibilities are endless.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21522\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/What-Is-Urbex-Travel-Trends-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Why the Urbex Travel Trend is The Coolest New Thing in Adventure Travel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></p><h2>What Type of Traveler Will Enjoy Urbex?</h2><p>Urbexers rarely travel without their cameras, they strive to capture the mysterious moments and forgotten places in photos.
