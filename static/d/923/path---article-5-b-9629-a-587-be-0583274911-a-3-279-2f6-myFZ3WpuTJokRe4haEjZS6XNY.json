I was born and raised in Italy&#8217;s northeastermost corner, in the austro-hungaric city of Trieste, minutes away from the Slovenian border.

The Hotel is absolutely gorgeous and has great service, but its greater feature is that it&#8217;s connected to the best Wellness in town, the Wellness Ziva, allowing you to access it directly from your room wearing nothing more than your robe!

In it, there&#8217;s a very fancy Restaurant overlooking the lake. The view is absolutely amazing and they often perform live music and have much space for dancing. Again, she will fell exactly as a princess, so you should take her here if you&#8217;d like to ask some important question &#8230;. ;)</p><p>&#160;</p><p><b><i>Let&#8217;s talk desserts- what place makes the best?</i></b></p><p>&#160;</p><p>Once in Bled you have to taste the Bled&#8217;s typical cake. It&#8217;s a very big block of cream and pastry, and it&#8217;s really really good. The best ones can be found at Slascicarna Smon, inside Bled&#8217;s village.</p><p>&#160;</p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8309\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/BLED-RESTAURANT-WHERE-TO-EAT-A-BLONDE-AROUND-THE-WORLD-12.jpg?resize=534%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to lake bled \" width=\"534\" height=\"800\"><p>&#160;</p><p><b><i>Time for a great sunset view&#8230; where would you go?</i></b></p><p>&#160;</p><p>You would expect that the best sunset view would be on top of a hill overlooking the Lake and the mountains right?</p><p>Well, probably it is so, but my favorite spot to enjoy the <p>sunset is from the Wellness Ziva</p>, which is one of my absolute favorite places i the entire world. The Wellness Ziva is part of the Hotel Golf, and while offering a wide range of pools and wellness services, its best feature according to me it&#8217;s the outdoors jacuzzi overlooking the Lake, the Castle and the Alps. Sunset from there is something magical, especially during winter, when outside it&#8217;s so cold, and you&#8217;re enjoying this magnificent view from inside a steaming bubbling jacuzzi!</p><p>&#160;</p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8310\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/HOTEL-GOLF-WELLNESS-ZIVA-BLED-A-BLONDE-AROUND-THE-WORLD-3-copy.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to lake bled \" width=\"560\" height=\"374\"><p class=\"fusion-column-wrapper\"> [Book a room | Book a flight]</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8312 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/profile1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"luxury guide to lake bled a blonde around the world\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">Pam is an unusual italian chick with a passion for photography, sunsets and green tea ice cream.She likes to travel the world never renouncing to style and glamour, but always having in mind sustainability and respect for nature and other cultures.
