The stuff I remembered and still practice is mostly strategy and marketing. Which is also most relevant for entrepreneurship (which I do). But to be complete, I've also summarized finance and management theory.</p> <h2>My credentials</h2> <p><img src=\"/wp-content/plugins/simple-lazyload/blank_1x1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"302\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7878 sl_lazyimg\"></p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jul-21-2017-23-28-51.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"302\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7878\"><br> Don't believe anyone who talks on the internet!

It won't cover an actual program. But it's good to get it out there because MBA's are treated as some \"magical spell\" you get, but that's bullshit. It's just learning a lot of theories, and then mostly networking. I personally think even the networking part is bullshit unless you go to Harvard Business School. I never had ANY benefit of anybody I met from my business schools, except having lots of great fun nights drinking beer and cocktails. I'm sorry guys!</p> <p>Therefore, my advice is, use this thread as a starting point. Delve in specific concepts that you feel you need to know more about by Googling and using YouTube tutorials on business (there's lots now!). Then if you want, start a company as soon as possible or start working at new company so you can quickly learn the in-real-life practical knowledge, which, when combined with basic business theory, is pure gold for your career!</p> <h3>Should you get a real MBA</h3> <p>I'd strongly say no. Also it's highly disputable if you should study business. Business courses are sold as leading people to a career in upper management. But that's bullshit. The real top positions in big corporations are generally reserved for high-skilled engineers.</p> <p>Big business consultancies like McKinsey don't even hire business graduates anymore, they hire from universities of technology like MIT or TU Delft. Business graduates have a severe lack of hard skills like math and programming. On the other hand, engineers are generally the worst at marketing and selling their inventions. But I'd say focus on getting that hard skill first, then add some business juice to it which nowadays you can easily find on the internet!</p>  <p>P.S.
