It&#8217;s not that I want to make fun of people or have a rant- this is just meant to be an honest&#160;portrayal&#160;about my life in India through short anecdotes. I&#8217;ll also share here each week what I&#8217;ve been up to online outside Hippie in Heels.</p><h2>Writing I do&#160;other than Hippie in Heels:</h2><h2>Now for your story:</h2><p>One of my favorite things is that everyone rides a motorbike in India. A pretty lady in a sari or a man with 3 kids might be the driver of the bike. Infant babies sit up front on the drivers lap and little kids stand up front and hold on to the handlebars.</p><p>This would never happen in the U.S., a place where the media have a panic-attack over Gwyneth Paltrow taking her little girl on a moped without a helmet.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4859\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2014-06-05-at-1.47.27-PM.jpg?resize=560%2C417&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india three\" width=\"560\" height=\"417\"></p><p>I have never seen a child wear a helmet on a bike in India. I feel like I don&#8217;t even need to mention this, but&#8230; traffic in India is INSANE.</p><p>So, I have gotten used to the babies on the bikes, even three babies on a bike. But what Ben saw today was new: a motorbike with 3 live pigs stacked on top of each other at the guys&#8217; feet.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2014-06-05-at-1.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=560%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"this is india three\" width=\"560\" height=\"472\"></p><h1>This is India!</h1><p>Did you enjoy this post?
