They&#8217;ll show you two photos at a time, one &#8220;home&#8221; aka UK, and one &#8220;away&#8221; of beaches and waterfalls. Just make your guess and see how many of the ten you get right.</p><p>Make sure after you finish the quiz, you enter you e-mail after so they can contact you if you win.</p><p>Crossing my fingers!</p><p><a href=\"http://www.parkdeanholidays.co.uk/homeorawayquiz/\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Enter to win a fantastic Parkdean Holiday worth up to &#163;750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.parkdeanholidays.co.uk/homeorawayquiz/homeagency/App_Graphics/embed.jpg?resize=403%2C403\" alt=\"Enter to win a fantastic Parkdean Holiday worth up to &#163;750\" width=\"403\" height=\"403\" border=\"0\"></a></p><p>Did know Newquay from Nice?
