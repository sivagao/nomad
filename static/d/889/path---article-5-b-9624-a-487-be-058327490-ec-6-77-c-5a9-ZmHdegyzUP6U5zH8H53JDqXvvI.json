It was a pleasure to write How A Long Way Round Shaped Travel for A Traveler&#8217;s Library about how this particular book influenced my travels.</p>\n<p>I originally heard about the trip (which book is based on) in a magazine my uncle handed me in 2003. The trip was still in the planning stages but it had me hooked and lusting for the road. I actually kept the magazine and still have it as a reminder of the joys of traveling, which can be easy to forget in the modern world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://atravelerslibrary.com/\">A Traveler&#8217;s Library</a> is one of my regular reads and if you love books and travel it&#8217;s an excellent site to keep up on. I hope that you&#8217;ll read my guest post How A Long Way Round Shaped Travel and check out some of Vera&#8217;s other wonderful posts.</p>\n<p>[photo by: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kranich/\">Fred Kranich</a>]</p>\n<p class=\"swp-content-locator\"></p><p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"></p></div>","title":"The Book That Continues To Inspire My Travels"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b9624a487be058327490ec6"}}
