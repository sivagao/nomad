After speaking to many of my friends, I found that they&#8217;re digital nomads, and wanted to know how they did it. They were freelancers and had several clients at once, enabling them to work from anywhere in the world.</p><p name=\"9596\" id=\"9596\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My partner is also a freelance graphic designer, so she too could be based anywhere.</p><p name=\"b217\" id=\"b217\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I then joined <a href=\"https://www.leadfeeder.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LeadFeeder</a>, a Finnish company who wanted to expand their UK market. They&#8217;re an entirely remote company so I began working remotely for them. Although I do some social media consulting on the side, they were my main source of work. The freedom of this remote work has led me to places including France, Canada, Finland, and of course Estonia.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*m7NeBlKAtpCPKLhULxlyCA.jpeg\"><h3 name=\"d1e1\" id=\"d1e1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">What does your business&#160;do?</h3><p name=\"b9ea\" id=\"b9ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Although I have an Estonian company, I don&#8217;t have a business per se, I&#8217;m a freelance business developer and social media consultant for one client&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;LeadFeeder.</p><h3 name=\"dae7\" id=\"dae7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">How did you hear about e-residency?</h3><p name=\"3004\" id=\"3004\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I found out from a friend, <a href=\"https://blog.leapin.eu/thinking-about-becoming-a-digital-nomad-d290061c9f16\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zack Young</a>, who&#8217;s also a customer of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/NQQK7X\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LeapIN</a>, when discussing my situation with him. He suggested the e-Residency programme, it&#8217;s benefits, and why I should do it.</p><h3 name=\"2bb6\" id=\"2bb6\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">So, with one client, why the&#160;need?</h3><p name=\"11f3\" id=\"11f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Digital Technology</strong></p><p name=\"5e79\" id=\"5e79\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Several reasons really, some more logical than others! I like the &#8216;coolness&#8217; factor of being involved in advanced digital technology&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;nice to keep updated on developments when I work within the tech sector.</p><p name=\"58d9\" id=\"58d9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Low-cost accounting and administration</strong></p><p name=\"23a4\" id=\"23a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was self-employed in the UK and the whole process of setting up a company takes a long time, and I hate accounting. Using LeapIN did all that for me and wasn&#8217;t as expensive as it would be in the UK.</p><p name=\"db1b\" id=\"db1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Manage from anywhere, even the remote wilderness of Canada</strong></p><p name=\"5953\" id=\"5953\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I particularly liked about <a href=\"https://goo.gl/NQQK7X\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LeapIN</a> is the flexibility of managing my company from anywhere. Recently I was in a remote location in Canada with no wifi. After connecting to 3G, I logged in to my LeapIN portal and uploaded 4 invoices that needed to be processed. It was done in a few minutes&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;the fact that I know my administration and compliance is handled when I travel (which is frequently) is a relief.</p></div>","title":"Why e-Residency and LeapIN Is the Ideal Solution for a Digital Nomad"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937ae287be056953db7ce7"}}
