I&#8217;m not Sarah Drasner but shit son.</p><p name=\"3286\" id=\"3286\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I keep hearing this like:</p><blockquote name=\"b4c8\" id=\"b4c8\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Oh I wish I had your job, you get to travel Europe for free, that is so cool&#160;!</blockquote><p name=\"9ff6\" id=\"9ff6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">I&#8217;m still friends with my high school friends even though we are now completely different people we would trust our life into each other, I guess the gay weirdos stick together. They are the ones that say this the most because they all still live where we grew up and in their heads I have the dream life.</p><p name=\"280d\" id=\"280d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t take me wrong it&#8217;s fucking awesome, I do get to travel europe for free mostly and also get to meet incredible people.</p><p name=\"203c\" id=\"203c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also get to unmeet them tho, I spend a week in every place so I get to meet incredible humans and then the week later they are gone and so am I. So I end up making friends everywhere but I rarely see them again.</p><p name=\"26c8\" id=\"26c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But the thing is, my job doesn&#8217;t make me do this, they like it because it spreads the name of the company but besides some in London all these places I went I did because I sent the CFP or was invited, I did this on my own.</p><p name=\"a293\" id=\"a293\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have been thinking a lot about why the fuck I do this and prefer to live this life and not stand still and I reached a conclusion, and that by itself is a miracle in my life trust me.</p><p name=\"0a0e\" id=\"0a0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I realised that the reason I want this and do all these conferences and just travel without a destination is because I don&#8217;t have a home.</p><p name=\"4d40\" id=\"4d40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have a house in the middle of nowhere in Portugal, but no home, there is not a place that when I am in it I call it home, a place that I really don&#8217;t want to leave.</p><p name=\"339d\" id=\"339d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The reason I travel so much is because I am trying to find my home, the place I feel like I am at home.</p><p name=\"96ed\" id=\"96ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don&#8217;t take me wrong, I love doing this and I do know how incredibly lucky I am to have this life but sometimes I just wish I had a home somewhere. Somewhere I where I would unpack when I get there and truly felt at home.</p><p name=\"5584\" id=\"5584\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some people envy me because I have no one to give satisfactions to and I sometimes envy them because they do.</p><p name=\"b192\" id=\"b192\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I&#8217;m going everywhere because in fact I have nowhere to go.</p></div>","title":"Isn’t being a nomad just being homeless ? – Sara Vieira – Medium"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b937b1887be056953db7d1c"}}
