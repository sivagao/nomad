If your career isn&#8217;t a big priority for you, that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s okay to just &#8220;get by&#8221;, as long as you&#8217;re doing it consciously.</p><p name=\"b984\" id=\"b984\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But if you&#8217;re reading Medium, you&#8217;re probably not like the average person. You&#8217;re probably looking for more than just a &#8220;so-so&#8221; career that pays the bills. You want to make an impact, you want to feel excited to get up every Monday morning instead of feeling like it&#8217;s &#8220;just another week.&#8221;</p><p name=\"e749\" id=\"e749\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There&#8217;s a lot that goes into finding work you love&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;like figuring out what you want to do, making connections in a non-sleazy way, and crafting a standout application.</p><p name=\"6137\" id=\"6137\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But the truth is, the biggest reason why people aren&#8217;t excited about their jobs isn&#8217;t because they haven&#8217;t figured out what they want to do.</p><p name=\"d4ca\" id=\"d4ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s because of the office.</p><p name=\"9600\" id=\"9600\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Working in an office can be confining in many ways.</p><p name=\"9e6c\" id=\"9e6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The upside is that you get to interact with your coworkers pretty regularly. But the downside is that you&#8217;re stuck to a routine.</p><p name=\"ec78\" id=\"ec78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You&#8217;ve got to hit the gym early in the morning or after work&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;when it&#8217;s packed. You&#8217;ve got to commute back and forth from work every day&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;potentially getting stuck in traffic. You&#8217;ve got to stand in a long line at the coffee shop every morning to pick up your latte. Then, you&#8217;ve got to deal with people interrupting you every 10 minutes at the office for some &#8220;urgent request.&#8221;</p><p name=\"8b80\" id=\"8b80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There&#8217;s a reason why so many companies are starting to offer remote jobs nowadays.</p><p name=\"f771\" id=\"f771\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Aside from lower costs, companies that do remote work have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/05/02/are-remote-workers-happier-and-more-productive-new-survey-offers-answers/#294173146663\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">happier employees</a> who feel more respected and valued at work.</p><p name=\"eee4\" id=\"eee4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And 91% of remote workers say that they get more done when they&#8217;re away from the office.</p><p name=\"edeb\" id=\"edeb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Imagine how much your day-to-day could change if you had the chance to work remotely.</p><p name=\"3db7\" id=\"3db7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could hit the gym in the middle of the day when there&#8217;s no one there.</p><p name=\"b00b\" id=\"b00b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could skip the commute, and get some more &#8220;breathing room&#8221; every morning instead of trying to beat traffic.</p><p name=\"abe4\" id=\"abe4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could focus on your biggest priorities at work, without getting interrupted.</p><p name=\"103b\" id=\"103b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could even do the whole &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; thing, <a href=\"http://landanyjobyouwant.com/unexpected-lessons-learned-from-traveling-the-world/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">traveling the world while working from your laptop</a>.</p><p name=\"63ae\" id=\"63ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These jobs used to be limited to mostly developers, designers, or writers. But now, remote jobs are available to more people in a variety of different fields.</p><p name=\"9783\" id=\"9783\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And <a href=\"http://angel.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AngelList</a> is a great place to find them.</p><h3 name=\"a199\" id=\"a199\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Why <a href=\"http://angel.co\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AngelList</a>?</h3><p name=\"9dda\" id=\"9dda\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">People think of AngelList as a tool that startups use to get funding. But a lot of them don&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s also one of the best job search sites out there today.</p><p name=\"37c3\" id=\"37c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, most companies have a little secret when they evaluate candidates&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;sometimes, they judge applicants based on the site they applied through.</p><p name=\"c0e4\" id=\"c0e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some job sites have a history of bringing in higher quality applicants, and other sites typically bring in lower quality applicants. AngelList is one of those sites that&#8217;s known as a &#8220;high quality applicant site.&#8221;</p><p name=\"00c3\" id=\"00c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, it&#8217;s pretty easy to find remote jobs in virtually any field with their filters&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;even if you&#8217;re not a designer, developer, or marketer.</p><p name=\"f6ae\" id=\"f6ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, click on the &#8220;jobs&#8221; button along the top of the nav bar:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5090LSf4lgEa7tlF56dnUw.png\"><p name=\"8742\" id=\"8742\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Then, pick what type of role you want using the filters:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rENJZwCxI1Pq6rKeBasuVg.png\"><p name=\"8f3b\" id=\"8f3b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Then, mouse over the &#8220;job type&#8221; label, and click &#8220;Remote OK&#8221;:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OfCLyJEtQvdab66gDOFWtA.png\"><p name=\"28cc\" id=\"28cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Also, you can choose whether you&#8217;re looking for a full time job, contract position or something else under &#8220;job type&#8221;:</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i_WSXyErHmISKcG-FVSvTw.png\"><p name=\"c235\" id=\"c235\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">There are a lot of other platforms that also have remote jobs, but AngelList makes it easiest to browse through them.</p><p name=\"7f0c\" id=\"7f0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can follow these steps to land your dream remote job, and add some insane flexibility into your schedule.</p><h3 name=\"87be\" id=\"87be\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">First, target 3&#8211;5 jobs you&#8217;re interested in</h3><p name=\"e9da\" id=\"e9da\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">What you DON&#8217;T want to do is mass-apply to tons of jobs at the same time.</p><p name=\"b0f2\" id=\"b0f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the biggest frustrations of employers is all the generic cover letters and resumes they get from people who don&#8217;t even seem like they read the job description.</p><p name=\"d36c\" id=\"d36c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You&#8217;ll be different. You&#8217;ll pick just a handful of companies to apply to, and crush them all.</p><p name=\"aee7\" id=\"aee7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once you pick your 3&#8211;5 companies, move on to step 3.</p><h3 name=\"d93f\" id=\"d93f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Next, yourself apart from everybody else</h3><p name=\"72ff\" id=\"72ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">When I was applying for content marketing positions a year or so ago, I didn&#8217;t just shoot off a generic cover letter.</p><p name=\"3677\" id=\"3677\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I knew that there would probably be hundreds of other people applying for the job, and they would all be doing the same thing.</p><p name=\"7158\" id=\"7158\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When hundreds of people are sending out resumes and cover letters, the way to compete with them isn&#8217;t by writing a better cover letter or resume. It&#8217;s by being proactive and going beyond the resume&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and proving to employers that you can help them solve their problems.</p><p name=\"0057\" id=\"0057\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So after applying online, I sent an email to the CEO with specific ideas about how they could improve their content marketing strategy.</p><p name=\"9cef\" id=\"9cef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I got an email back pretty quickly to schedule an interview.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ng0Txy1Pgw6qjUgiSZPQyw.png\"><p name=\"cc72\" id=\"cc72\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This strategy works super well for companies that are listed on AngelListbecause most of them are startups. And startup founders LOVE people who are proactive.</p><p name=\"a7db\" id=\"a7db\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, if you&#8217;re a software developer, <a href=\"http://landanyjobyouwant.com/case-study-how-nick-got-his-dream-job-and-a-six-figure-salary-without-the-right-experience\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you could create a program</a> that proves that you have some key skills that they&#8217;re looking for. If you&#8217;re a designer, you could run a usability test on their product and come up with some design suggestions <a href=\"https://medium.com/interactive-mind/airbnb-guerilla-usability-testing-548b4676d06c#.1b15p6sww\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">like I did for Airbnb</a>.</p><p name=\"4bb7\" id=\"4bb7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You can also just list a few suggestions of how the company can improve in the area you&#8217;re applying for, like I did.</p><p name=\"2e8f\" id=\"2e8f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Or you can create a 30&#8211;60&#8211;90 day plan for what you&#8217;d do if you get hired.Noah Kagan did this for Mint.com and got a job as their Director of Marketing.</p><p name=\"5f94\" id=\"5f94\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you feel like none of those things will work for you, you could just create a case study write up of how you helped a company in the past in a role similar to what you&#8217;re applying for.</p><p name=\"21b5\" id=\"21b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here&#8217;s an email script you can use to send your project over to your company:</p><blockquote name=\"8b00\" id=\"8b00\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Hi [name],</blockquote><blockquote name=\"81fa\" id=\"81fa\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">I&#8217;m [your name] and I noticed you&#8217;re hiring a [position], and I&#8217;m interested. I thought it would be helpful for me to [insert a good description of your pre-interviewproject] to both show my interest and the value I could bring to [company].</blockquote><blockquote name=\"c57e\" id=\"c57e\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">[Present the project here&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;if you just did a writeup (i.e. a design suggestion) then a link or image would do. If you pitched businesses for partnerships, ask if the person you&#8217;re emailing would like to be introduced, etc]</blockquote><blockquote name=\"2f25\" id=\"2f25\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">Quick background on me: [insert a quick 2&#8211;3 sentence summary of your background as it relates to this job]</blockquote><blockquote name=\"6532\" id=\"6532\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">Thanks so much for your time&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;hope to hear from you regarding next steps!</blockquote><blockquote name=\"9aaf\" id=\"9aaf\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">Best,</blockquote><blockquote name=\"87da\" id=\"87da\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">[your name]</blockquote><p name=\"8281\" id=\"8281\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">In my experience, it&#8217;s best to send this over to the CEO or someone from the founding team if you&#8217;re applying for a startup. Or the director of the department you&#8217;re applying for.</p><p name=\"df97\" id=\"df97\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You could also just hit the &#8220;apply&#8221; button on the job posting, and submit your project through there.</p><p name=\"5f4a\" id=\"5f4a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This approach gets you noticed, and helps you make the great first impression &#8220;on paper&#8221; so that they like you before they ever even talk to you.</p><p name=\"f5b8\" id=\"f5b8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The &#8220;hidden benefit&#8221; of this approach is that it helps you drive the conversation during your interviews, because you&#8217;ll get to talk about the project you sent over.</p><p name=\"669a\" id=\"669a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I did this, I ended up going from application to offer in a matter of days.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4xJLIP36cukfoxaya9ga-w.png\"><p name=\"6577\" id=\"6577\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">And I bought a one way ticket to Bangkok a few weeks later.</p><h3 name=\"04cf\" id=\"04cf\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conclusion</h3><p name=\"6dd1\" id=\"6dd1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Landing a remote work position isn&#8217;t as hard as people make it out to be.
