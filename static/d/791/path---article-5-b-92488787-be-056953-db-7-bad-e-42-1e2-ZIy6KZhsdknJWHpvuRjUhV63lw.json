I want to create a Tokyo street scene in 3d. I've never done any 3d before. Two days ago, I <a href=\"http://levels.io/learning-3d-day-27/\">added lots of small details</a> like manholes and found more reference material to use.</p> <p>Today a loooot happened, so this is a long post. Be sure to skip through if it gets boring. I added lots of pictures, so you can follow it easily :)</p> <h2>Replacing the bar panels</h2> <p>The old wood was a bit too bright:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/day-25-bar254-wood-carve-2-light.jpg\" alt=\"day-25-bar254-wood-carve-2-light\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5755 responsively-lazy\"> <p>...so today I picked a dark wood texture to replace it:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-wood-logo.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-wood logo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5896 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Scruffy bar doors</h2> <p>Today I also wanted to design the bar's scruffy doors with its wooden paneling.</p> <p>I started with one big door panel, then added 4 cubes that I boole'd through them. Then I added 4 more smaller panels to add depth inside. I know real paneled doors have a more curved style. But I have to speed up the modeling now so I'll have to skip some details (for now):</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-render-no-glass.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-render no glass\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5891 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Making glass</h2> <p>As with most things in Cinema4D, making glass was surprisingly easy too. I created a new material and then I clicked Transparency:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-01-03.32.58.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-01 03.32.58\" width=\"1368\" height=\"1258\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5880 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Changing the refraction value from 1 and up creates real glass, and it just becomes more reflective after that. Adding it as a panel in the door made it look like this:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-02-30-glass-2.jpg\" alt=\"2016-02-30-glass 2\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5889 responsively-lazy\"> <p>There's also a nice blurriness setting at the bottom. The blur it creates is more of a dusty mess (but pretty) though:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-render-w-glass-blur.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-render w glass blur\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5892 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Making other materials reflective</h2> <p>Inspired how I now could make glass. I wanted to fix the carved Bar254 in the panel. It was wood before:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-wood-logo.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-wood logo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5896 responsively-lazy\"> <p>...but I knew from the photos it was actually some kinda shiny rusty metal:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-02.00.23.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 02.00.23\" width=\"1034\" height=\"510\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5894 responsively-lazy\"> <p>So I tried to make it:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-metal-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-metal\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5922 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Not completely there, but it's getting there. Might have to add some rust later.</p> <p>&lt;</p> <p>h2&gt;Aircon wall mounts</p> <p>&lt;</p> <p>h2&gt;<br> The aircon's actually don't just hang in the air like I thought. They stand on wall mounts:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-29-21.55.43.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-02-29 21.55.43\" width=\"950\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5848 responsively-lazy\"> <p>So I made a wall mount:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-01-18.27.32-1-1024x588.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-01 18.27.32\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5915 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And set it up:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-01-18.42.53-2-1024x589.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-01 18.42.53\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5916 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Aircon cabinet</h2> <p>There was also a cabinet for the aircon in front of the bar from wood:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-17.10.50-1024x556.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 17.10.50\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5923 responsively-lazy\"> <p>So I built that:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-aircon-box-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-aircon box\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5925 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I think they use it as some kind of extended bar to drink outside. So, now they can drink outside in VR too. Yay!</p> <h2>Asphalt desaturation</h2> <p>The asphalt was a bit too blue before:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-asphalt-before-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-asphalt before\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5917 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This gave me some problems with the colored lights. Because the street started turning green with orange and blue lit on it, so I made it a bit more neutral. I know this stuff is very subtle but important:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-asphalt-after-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-asphalt after\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5918 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Canvas on wine barrel</h2> <p>I quickly added the canvas:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-16.57.26.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 16.57.26\" width=\"848\" height=\"598\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5919 responsively-lazy\"> <p>It has the same texture as the wooden menu in front, because I didn't have time to make its own. But I'll do that later. For now, most important is speed.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-canvas-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-canvas\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5920 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Orange light bulbs</h2> <p>The light bulbs actually aren't white:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-street-after-move4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-street after move4\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5903 responsively-lazy\"> <p>But light orangey, so I fixed that:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-bulbs-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-bulbs\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5921 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Extreme HD rendering</h2> <p>As you might see from some of the pics in this post, I finally started rendering in HD, as before I was capped to C4D's 800x600 demo limit. It looks really good. The only thing is that now that everything looks so high-res, you really need the proper details and lighting to make it look realistic.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-render-hd5-without-graded.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-render hd5 without graded\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5865 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Fixing the lights</h2> <p>This is why I've started to analyze the original photo carefully.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/makashiwakui_header-1024x582.jpg\" alt=\"makashiwakui_header\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5450 responsively-lazy\"> <p>The lighting is orange vs. blue. Most of the picture has some source of orange either from lanterns or lamps. At the end of the street is a big blue light though which is panned slightly to the left. It gives the picture a kind of unfolding story that gets blue-er the deeper you go and ends with the guy standing at the end with his back towards you.</p> <p>The main lights now are:<br> - The orange bulb in the wooden paneling on the right<br> - The orange lantern in front of it<br> - The lamp above the Bar254 menu<br> - The orange lamp above the Bar254 hanging sign<br> - The orange lamp above the Bar254 carved logo<br> - The red lantern on the end left<br> - The white lantern on the end left<br> - The red lantern on the middle right<br> - The red lantern at the end right<br> - The blue area light at the end (arguably the most important)</p> <p>There's a few signs emitting strong light too, like the CyberDAM sign and the white logo sign in the end of the street. They have textures with illumination so they overpower the general lighting falling on them.</p> <h2>Color grading during render</h2> <p>In Cinema4D's render settings, it actually has a nice color corrector built it. To keep things simple I'd rather use that one as it's internal than having to keep color correcting from Photoshop afterwards.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-01.24.03-1024x697.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.24.03\" width=\"640\" height=\"436\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5864 responsively-lazy\"> <p>The issue is to preview whatever you're doing in that panel, you have to keep rendering your scene and that takes awhile. So it's not very intuitive. I got pretty close though. Not completely happy but I'll have to tweak it later.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-render-hd5-with-graded.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-render hd5 with graded\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5874 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Rounding the aircons</h2> <p>A wiser man than me once said \"an aircon's gotta be round\". Because a square one looks like a cardboard prop:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-aircon-without-radius-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-aircon without radius\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5911 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Being a CSS-head, I googled \"border radius cinema4d\" and found it's called Fillet. And you can set it on any object you make under the Object Properties:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-16.48.22-1024x785.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 16.48.22\" width=\"640\" height=\"491\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5914 responsively-lazy\"> <p>You can set the radius, but also subdivisions. If you set 1 division, you'll get a very sharp corner. The more divisions you set though, it will decrease performance a bit when rendering.</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-02.35.49-1024x673.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 02.35.49\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5913 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Rendered it's a subtle difference but important for realism:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-aircon-with-radius-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-aircon with radius\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5912 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Recreating the OPEN sign</h2> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-03.19.48.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 03.19.48\" width=\"1294\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5904 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This was pretty fun. I had to recreate the OPEN sign texture. I took out my iPad, opened up ProCreate and took a similar brush and tried it:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2016-03-02-164159.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2016-03-02 16:41:59\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5906 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Pretty cool:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2016-03-02-164205.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2016-03-02 16:42:05\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5905 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Then with some edits in Photoshop:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/open-sign-1024x401.jpg\" alt=\"open sign\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5907 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And rendered:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-open-sign2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-open sign2\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5908 responsively-lazy\"> <h2>Moving the left side of the street</h2> <p>I started seeing the issue that when comparing my scene with the photo, the left side of the street was way too far away from the right part. I had to move it. I was already getting nightmares from thinking of separately selecting each object. Luckily, Cinema4D has an excellent lasso selection tool:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-16.35.47.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 16.35.47\" width=\"1030\" height=\"442\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5899 responsively-lazy\"> <p>With that I could easily select the left side:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-03.31.48.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 03.31.48\" width=\"2422\" height=\"1434\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5900 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Here's it before:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-street-before-move.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-street before move\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5902 responsively-lazy\"> <p>And after:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-street-after-move.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-street after move\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5901 responsively-lazy\"> <p>I had to correct some stuff that was moved wrongly:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-01-street-after-move4.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-01-street after move4\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5903 responsively-lazy\"> <p>Much better!</p> <h2>Japanese text</h2> <p>Because I wasn't able to read what was on the lanterns I just randomly picked some text from the internet, which resulted in these situations:</p> <img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-02-17.58.36.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-03-02 17.58.36\" width=\"1002\" height=\"676\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5931 responsively-lazy\"> <p>This street is definitely NOT a UNESCO heritage site, maybe it should be though? :P</p> <p>So I asked Twitter if they could send me the correct Japanese characters for these lanterns:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can any Japanese speakers write me the characters for these 4 lanterns?
