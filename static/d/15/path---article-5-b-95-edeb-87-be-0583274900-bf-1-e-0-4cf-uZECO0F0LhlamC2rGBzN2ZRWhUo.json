We treated ourselves to a three-bedroom deluxe suite that is literally as big as our two-story townhouse in Chiang Mai. The spacious layout had us and our three family members, who were visiting Bangkok for the first time, feeling comfortable and at home. It also offered retreat from the lively city while still being positioned as an excellent access point to some of the more popular areas of Bangkok.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9269\" title=\"Chatrium Residence Sathorn Building\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Chatrium.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Chatrium Residence Sathorn Views\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>We had a great first impression of the <a title=\"Chatrium Residence Sathorn Bangkok\" href=\"https://www.tielandtothailand.com/recommends/chatrium-residence-sathorn-bangkok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chatrium Residence Sathorn</a>. An expansive lobby area greeted us and then we were guided to our sky-high suite and made sure everything was set up well. On our way up to our suite, we passed by the pool and nearby outdoor bar, as well as the on site Albricias Restaurant, which is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Living_and_Dining_Area\"><p>Living and Dining Area</p></p></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9251\" title=\"Massive Living and Dining Room\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.tielandtothailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Chatrium-Living-Room.jpg?resize=563%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Chatrium Sathorn Living and Dining Room\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p><strong>The three-bedroom suite felt like a luxury condo</strong>&#160;and allowed for plenty of space for the five of us while we enjoyed two nights in Bangkok.</p>\n<p>The suite opens up to a large, well decorated living area that has plenty of sitting and dining space.

We appreciated being guided to our suite since the hotel is composed of several towers. In addition to welcome drinks, we were also provided with extra toiletries for our group of five as we asked for them. Later, our request for extra towels, pillows, and water was also immediately met.</p>\n<h2><p id=\"Chatrium_Residence_Sathorn_Details_and_Amenities\"><p>Chatrium Residence Sathorn: Details and Amenities</p></p></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>140 sq m (1,500 sq ft)</p></li>\n<li><p>Master bedroom with on-suite bathroom</p></li>\n<li><p>Two additional bedrooms</p></li>\n<li><p>Desks, TVs, and wardrobes in each bedroom</p></li>\n<li><p>Bath tubs, vent fans, and hot and cold water taps</p></li>\n<li><p>Living room with comfy couch and large dining table</p></li>\n<li><p>Full kitchen</p></li>\n<li><p>Great views of the city from multiple balconies</p></li>\n<li><p>On-site restaurant, outdoor bar, and pool</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><p id=\"Suggestions\"><p>Suggestions</p></p></h2>\n<p>One area of improvement is the WiFi connection.
