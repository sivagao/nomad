I Love You.</p><p>The movie by itself is sweet and heartfelt, but the scenes based in Ireland seriously had me itching to grab an umbrella and run away to the Emerald Isle.</p><p>So while planning my trip to Ireland, I must confess, I must have watched the movie at least 3 times and was determined to visit all the lovely spots highlighted in the movie. I drooled over the beautiful scenery and couldn&#8217;t wait to explore all of the lakes, misty mountains, and quaint villages featured.</p><h1>The PS I Love You Guide to Ireland</h1><p>If you&#8217;re like me and found yourself daydreaming about Ireland; casually boating around beautiful lakes by day, and being serenaded at the local pub by night&#8230;then this post is for you.</p><h2>Dublin</h2><p>Naturally, you just can&#8217;t film a movie in Ireland without incorporating <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/3-days-in-dublin-howth-cliffs/\">Dublin</a>.</p><p>The romantic and fun loving pub scene where Gerry finds Holly in the crowd and sings Galway Girl to her was actually filmed at Whelan&#8217;s pub on Wexford Street. True to the film, Whelan&#8217;s is a venue for live music&#160;and is an outstanding traditional Irish pub.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/_R7_qrxgBf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Whelan&#8217;s Bar (@whelanslive)</a> on Dec 14, 2015 at 9:16am PST</p></blockquote><p></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21703\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

I Love You&#8221; Guide to Ireland\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\"></p><p>If you&#8217;re looking for other popular areas for traditional pubs in Ireland, Temple Bar is the place to go. Although it caters to the tourists, it&#8217;s the spot for <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/travel-tips-for-dublin-ireland/\">Dublin&#8217;s pub scene and nightlife.</a></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21696\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

I Love You&#8221; Guide to Ireland\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p><h2>County Wicklow</h2><p>Take a deep breath and inhale that cool mountain air&#8230;you are now in County Wicklow.</p><p>About an hour&#8217;s drive south of Dublin, you enter into Ireland&#8217;s gorgeous countryside where the majority of the Ireland scenes from P.S. I Love You were filmed.</p><p>Rugged and romantic, it&#8217;s not much of a surprise why Wicklow was chosen. County Wicklow is known as the Garden of Ireland, and it&#8217;s rich in history and folklore.</p><p>But P.S. I Love You isn&#8217;t the first movie filmed in this part of Ireland. Wicklow seems to be Hollywood&#8217;s filming location of choice with Braveheart also being filmed here.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21697\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

I Love You&#8221; Guide to Ireland\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"></p><h2>The Sally Gap</h2><p>In the heart of the Wicklow Mountains National Park, you will find Sally Gap.</p><p>This location is special because it is the spot where Holly and Gerry first meet (and later kiss!). This scenic mountain pass is the perfect location for a romantic meeting place.</p><p>The landscape has a serene and peaceful feel to it with miles of greenery speckled with the most adorable cotton-balled sheep.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21704\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-10.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

I Love You&#8221; Guide to Ireland\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\"></p><h2>Lacken Village</h2><p>As Holly and Gerry walk through the Wicklow countryside, they are in fact walking towards the small village of Lacken.</p><p>Most noted for its scenic views of the Blessington Lakes, this quaint village is worth a stop, even if only for the photos.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21706\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

I Love You&#8221; Guide to Ireland\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\"></p><h2>Blessington Lakes</h2><p>One of my favorite scenes from the movie was filmed on Blessington Lake.</p><p>Gerry surprises Holly by sending her and her closest girlfriends to Ireland. While spending the day fishing on the lake, the gals manage to get stuck, and have to be rescued by a ruggedly handsome Irishman (yes, because this happens all the time&#8230;).<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21707\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.

While walking through the valley, you&#8217;ll find it has a tranquil and almost spiritual feel to it.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/hippie-inheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ps-i-love-you-guide-to-ireland-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The &#8220;P.S.
