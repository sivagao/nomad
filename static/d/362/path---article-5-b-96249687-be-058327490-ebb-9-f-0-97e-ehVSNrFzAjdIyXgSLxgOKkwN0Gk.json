BusinessWeek reports there are <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/nov2007/sb2007118_006807.htm\">some clues</a> to look for to tell if the hotel you&#8217;re staying at has a bedbug problem on their hands.</p>\n<p>Check if the mattress has an &#8220;allergy-free&#8221; (formerlly known as bug-free) bed cover on it. Hotel dogs walking around with sniffing dogs in the lobby are also a good indicator.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the little critters are found in hotels of varying classes, including 4 and 5-star ones. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedbug\">Bedbugs</a> can live without a meal for more than a year and hitch rides around the world in your luggage.
