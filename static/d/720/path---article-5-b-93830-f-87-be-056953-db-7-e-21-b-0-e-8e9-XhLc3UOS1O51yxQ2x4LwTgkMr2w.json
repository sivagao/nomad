Companies benefit, too.</p><p class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></p><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nCei5-biuarAE-wOZ6_BDQ.jpeg\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/I1AtHM9a5RA?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NeONBRAND</a> on&#160;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/remote%20work?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p name=\"4c18\" id=\"4c18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">A former colleague recently described <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/effective-tips-for-working-remotely-23cc290a8c08\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">remote working</a> as an employee &#8220;perk.&#8221; Most of the companies I&#8217;ve worked for share the same mentality. In their eyes, it&#8217;s a reward for good behavior: if you show up on time and do your work, then you get to work remotely someday. What&#8217;s rarely acknowledged, however, is that remote work also benefits the employer.</p><h3 name=\"e9e7\" id=\"e9e7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Company Benefits</h3><p name=\"0c34\" id=\"0c34\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Companies with a remote staff could save money. That&#8217;s what Cisco found in their <a href=\"https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2009 survey</a> of nearly 2,000 employees. &#8220;The company has generated an estimated annual savings of $277 million in productivity by allowing employees to telecommute and telework.&#8221; It&#8217;s reasonable to see why. Instead of paying rent for a huge downtown location, for example, companies can opt for a smaller office. A smaller space means reduced costs on utilities and equipment, not to mention fewer supplies for the kitchen and bathroom.</p><p name=\"7546\" id=\"7546\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Saving money is good, but let&#8217;s look at productivity. A whopping 91% of respondents in <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/TINYpulse_What_Leaders_Need_to_Know_About_Remote_Workers.pdf?t=1462203875281\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one survey</a> said they&#8217;re &#8220;more productive when working remotely.&#8221; The survey examined answers from over 500 American employees, 58% of them were between the ages of 25 and 44, who work remotely. Adding to the evidence is a <a href=\"https://people.stanford.edu/nbloom/sites/default/files/wfh.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2014 study</a> that compared the productivity of office-based and home-based employees at Ctrip, a Chinese travel service provider. The results were impressive.</p><p name=\"33b1\" id=\"33b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;People working from home completed 13.5% more calls than the staff in the office did,&#8221; explains <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Bloom</a>, a professor and an organizer of the Ctrip study. To put that in context, &#8220;Ctrip got almost an extra workday a week out of them.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t end there. The same study found that Ctrip saved nearly $2,000 for each employee during the nine-month experiment. Plus, attrition rates for home workers &#8220;<a href=\"https://people.stanford.edu/nbloom/sites/default/files/wfh.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fell by over 50%</a>.&#8221;</p><h3 name=\"d079\" id=\"d079\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Benefit is&#160;Mutual</h3><p name=\"aa69\" id=\"aa69\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">However, these benefits are often overshadowed by employee ones, which seem to be misunderstood. Some companies paint a vision of employees working in their pajamas, saving money on their attire and commute.</p><p name=\"ca56\" id=\"ca56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But what&#8217;s motivating for me, as an employee, is the autonomy to work where I like, instead of where someone else thinks I should work: in an open office with an endless number of visual and auditory distractions imposed upon me. It&#8217;s hard to get work done at work when phones buzz, people talk, and games chirp. Plus, it&#8217;s mentally exhausting to block out all these distractions, so when I can avoid them my productivity soars.</p><p name=\"096e\" id=\"096e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That&#8217;s why I see working remotely as a tool. It&#8217;s like having a company computer: both help me do my job better. Although I can write an article on a notepad, the entire researching, writing, and editing process is much more efficient and effective when I use my laptop. The same is true when it comes to remote working. It&#8217;s possible to write in a noisy open office, but I get far more quality writing done when I work remotely.</p><p name=\"2fd0\" id=\"2fd0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#8217;s not to say that offices need to go away entirely. In fact, there are benefits to going to the office for a few hours or even a couple of days each week, to work and collaborate with others. But employees should have a choice in the matter, and working remotely should be an option that&#8217;s readily available.</p><p name=\"bd56\" id=\"bd56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So instead of touting remote work as an employee &#8220;perk,&#8221; it should be regarded as a workplace feature that enables employees to do great work. In the end, my company and employee both win. I, as an employee, work how and where I like, and my company reaps the results, since I get far more quality work done when I work in an environment that fits my needs.</p><p name=\"ac44\" id=\"ac44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you enjoyed this article, then <a href=\"http://amymhaddad.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=bd9ac04321dc5549e9319ddb3&amp;id=11053c7cab\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to my blog newsletter</a>.
